However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.Objectives: To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been the same in both study arms.Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.Main results: Nine studies with 11,007 participants were included. Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality, three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity. In contrast, eight studies contributed data on WDAE. Included studies were of good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19), or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). Conversely, a high level of evidence indicated a slightly lower incidence of WDAE for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.8%, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 55 over 4.1 years), mainly attributable to a higher incidence of dry cough with ACE inhibitors. The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular events was judged to be low by the GRADE approach.Authors' conclusions: Our analyses found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or cardiovascular outcomes for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors, while ARBs caused slightly fewer WDAEs than ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy in these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for ARBs directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an ARB for an ACE inhibitor, while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of ARBs regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes compared with ACE inhibitors. Additionally, our data mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension, and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive participants in existing trials comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs needs to be made available for this purpose.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"803","type":"report","title":"Antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of trandolapril/verapamil combination: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["Zou, Z.","Xu, F.

Balloon angioplasty with stenting is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis but the effectiveness of this procedure in treating hypertension, improving renal function and preventing adverse cardiovascular and renal events remains uncertain. This is an update, to include the results of recent, important large trials, of a review first published in 2003.Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. The following outcomes were compared: blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of cardiovascular and renal adverse events, presence or absence of restenosis of the renal artery, side effects of medical therapy, numbers and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs.Search methods: For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 4). Bibliographies were also reviewed and trial authors were contacted for more information.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter) and with a minimum follow-up of six months.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently on trial design, participants, interventions and outcome measures. A formal meta-analysis was completed to assess the effect on blood pressure, renal function and cardiovascular and renal adverse events. Peto's odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous variables were calculated.Main results: Eight RCTs involving 2222 participants with renal artery stenosis were included in the review. The overall quality of evidence included in this review was moderate. Limited pooling of results was possible due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes. Meta-analysis of the four studies reporting change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) found a small improvement in diastolic BP in the angioplasty group (MD -2.00 mmHg; 95% CI -3.72 to -0.27) whilst the meta-analysis of the five studies reporting change in systolic BP did not find any evidence of significant improvement (MD -1.07 mmHg; 95% CI -3.45 to 1.30). There was no significant effect on renal function as measured by serum creatinine (MD -7.99 µmol/L; 95% CI -22.6 to 6.62). Meta-analysis of the three studies that reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs found a small decrease in antihypertensive drug requirements for the angioplasty group (MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03). Repeat angiography was only performed on a small number of participants in a single trial and it was therefore not possible to comment on restenosis of the renal artery following balloon angioplasty. Based on the results of the seven studies that reported cardiovascular and renal clinical outcomes there were no differences in cardiovascular (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) or renal adverse events (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38) between the angioplasty and medical treatment groups. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri-procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.Authors' conclusions: The available data are insufficient to conclude that revascularisation in the form of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, is superior to medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. However, balloon angioplasty resu ts in a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure and a small reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements. Balloon angioplasty appears safe and results in similar numbers of cardiovascular and renal adverse events to medical therapy.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"767","type":"report","title":"Banxia baizhu tianma decoction for essential hypertension: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine","authors":["Xiong, X.","Yang, X.","Liu, W.","Feng, B.","Ma, J.","Du, X.","Wang, P.","Chu, F.","Li, J.","Wang, J."],"date":"2012","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12013003300/frame.html"],"pages":"271462","volume":"2012","number":"4","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"348","type":"report","title":"Benefit assessment of long-term lowering of blood pressure to levels in the lower normal range in patients with diabetes mellitus - rapid report (Structured abstract)","journal":"Health Technology Assessment Database","authors":["IqwiG,"],"date":"2012","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clhta/articles/HTA-32013000386/frame.html"],"number":"4","tags":["Cochrane"]},{"recNumber":"347","type":"report","title":"Benefit assessment of non-drug treatment strategies in patients with essential hypertension: special diets without the primary aim of reducing weight or salt intake - rapid report (Structured abstract)","journal":"Health Technology Assessment Database","authors":["IqwiG,"],"date":"2011","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clhta/articles/HTA-32013000385/frame.html"],"number":"4","tags":["Cochrane","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"747","type":"report","title":"Beta-blockers for hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Wiysonge Charles, Shey","Bradley Hazel, A.","Volmink, Jimmy","Mayosi Bongani, M.","Mbewu, Anthony","Opie Lionel, H."],"date":"2012","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002003.pub4/abstract"],"number":"11","abstract":"Background: This review is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2007, which assessed the role of beta-blockade as first-line therapy for hypertension.Objectives: To quantify the effectiveness and safety of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.Search methods: In December 2011 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, and reference lists of previous reviews; for eligible studies published since the previous search we conducted in May 2006.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.Data collection and analysis: We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and combined them using the fixed-effects or random-effects method, as appropriate.Main results: We included 13 RCTs which compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 trials, N=23,613), diuretics (5 trials, N=18,241), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: 4 trials, N=44,825), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 trials, N=10,828). Three-quarters of the 40,245 participants on beta-blockers used atenolol. Most studies had a high risk of bias; resulting from various limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis.Total mortality was not significantly different between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.11; I2=0%), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.14; I2=2%). Total cardiovascular disease (CVD) was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.79 to 0.97; I2=21%). This is primarily a reflection of the significant decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.66 to 0.96; I2=0%), since there was no significant difference in coronary heart disease (CHD) between beta-blockers and placebo. There was no significant difference in withdrawals from assigned treatment due to adverse events between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 1.12, 95%CI 0.82 to 1.54; I2=66%).The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was significantly worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95%CI 1.08-1.29; I2=0%), but was not different from that of diuretics or RAS inhibitors. In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95%CI 1.11-1.40; I2=0%) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.53; I2=29%). However, CHD was not significantly different between beta-blockers and diuretics, CCBs or RAS inhibitors. Participants on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than those on RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; I2=12%), but there was no significant difference with diuretics or CCBs.Authors' conclusions: Initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest reductions in cardiovascular disease and no significant effects on mortality. These effects of beta-blockers are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. The GRADE quality of this evidence is low, implying that the true effect of beta-blockers may be substantially different from the estimate of effects found in this review. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different sub-types of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and elderly patients.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"91","type":"report","title":"Beta-blockers for primary prevention of heart failure in patients with hypertension: insights from a meta-analysis (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","authors":["Bangalore, S.","Wild, D.","Parkar, S.","Kukin, M.","Messerli, F.

The best but unsatisfactory estimate of the trough BP lowering efficacy for alpha blockers is -8/-5 mmHg.Authors' conclusions: Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the BP lowering effect of alpha blockers is modest; the estimate of the magnitude of trough BP lowering of -8/-5 mmHg is likely an overestimate.

The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was seen with adding a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers reduced heart rate by 10 beats/min at 1 to 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers did not statistically significantly increase withdrawals due to adverse effects but this was likely due to the lack of reporting of this outcome in 35% of the included RCTs.Authors' conclusions: Addition of a beta-blocker to diuretics or calcium-channel blockers reduces BP by 6/4mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and by 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. When the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers from this review was compared to that of thiazide diuretics from our previous review (Chen 2009), second-line beta-blockers reduce systolic BP to the same extent as second-line thiazide diuretics, but reduce diastolic BP to a greater degree. The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure. This difference in the pattern of BP lowering with beta-blockers as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that beta-blockers appear to be less effective at reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes than thiazide diuretics, particularly in older individuals.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"321","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for primary hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Ho Meghan, J.","Bellusci, Anthony","Wright James, M."],"date":"2009","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007435.pub2/abstract"],"number":"4","abstract":"Background: Studies have shown that coenzyme Q10 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease.

Thiazides as a second-line drug reduced BP by 6/3 and 8/4 mmHg at doses of 1 and 2 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose respectively. The BP lowering effect was dose related.

This means that the BP lowering effect of thiazides is additive. Loop diuretics appear to have a similar blood pressure lowering effect as thiazides at 1 times the recommended starting dose.

Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta-blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making.Objectives: To quantify the dose-related effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.Selection criteria: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.Main results: We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies. Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence). Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence). The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).Authors' conclusions: In people with mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonselective beta-blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of -10/-7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta-blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"750","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of partial agonist beta blocker monotherapy for primary hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Wong Gavin, W.

The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.Selection criteria: Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies must contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm with fixed dose. Patients enrolled into the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP > 140/90 mmHg). Duration of studies must be between three to 12 weeks.Data collection and analysis: Two authors (GW and HB) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently.Main results: Thirteen randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials that examined the blood pressure lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were included in this review. Five of the included studies were parallel studies and the other eight were cross-over studies. The overall risk of bias is high in this review due to the small sample size and high risk of detection bias. Pindolol, celiprolol and alprenolol lowered SBP and DBP compared to placebo. Acebutolol lowered SBP but there was no clear evidence that it lowered DBP. There was no clear evidence that pindolol and oxprenolol lowered SBP or DBP. Other than for celiprolol, sample sizes were generally small increasing the uncertainty in findings for individual agents versus placebo. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists (considered as a subclass) lowered peak BP by an average of 8 mmHg systolic (95% CI, -10 to -6, very low quality evidence), 4 mmHg diastolic (95%CI, -5 to -3, very low quality evidence) and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute (95%CI, -6 to -4, very low quality evidence). Higher dose partial agonists did not appear to provide additional BP lowering effects compared to lower dose. The maximum BP lowering effect of the overall subclass occurred at the starting dose. Partial agonists reduced pulse pressure by 4 mmHg (95% CI, -5 to -2, very low evidence). Only one study reported withdrawal due to adverse effects, the risk ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.07, 7.67).Authors' conclusions: There was very low quality evidence that in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists lowered peak BP by an average of 8/4 mmHg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute. There was no evidence of a greater effect at doses higher than the initial doses. This estimate was probably exaggerated as it was subject to a high risk of bias. Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane reviews on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which also used similar inclusion criteria as this review, the BP lowering effect appeared to be less than the effect in patients with mild to moderate elevated BP who were taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs based on an indirect comparison. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were only reported in one trial so it is impossible to assess the harm of these drugs.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"314","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of potassium-sparing diuretics (that block the epithelial sodium channel) for primary hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Heran Balraj, S.","Chen Jenny, M.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important target site for five antihypertensive drug classes: beta blockers, renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone inhibitors. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors prevent the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II . Renin inhibitors do not affect kinin metabolism and may produce fewer adverse effects than ACE inhibitors such as dry cough or angioedema.Objectives: To quantify the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors versus placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.Search methods: We searched the following databases for randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of renin inhibitors: Medline (1966-June 2011), EMBASE (1988-June 2011), Cochrane CENTRAL, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register and bibliographic citations from retrieved references. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Study design had to meet the following criteria: double-blinded, placebo-controlled; random allocation to a specific dose of renin inhibitor group and parallel placebo group; duration of follow-up of at least three weeks.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using risk of bias tables. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Data synthesis and analyses were done using the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 5.1.

Aliskiren was the only renin inhibitor studied in these studies. The meta-analysis shows that aliskiren has a dose-related systolic/diastolic blood pressure lowering effect as compared to placebo: aliskiren 75 mg -2.6/-2.1 mm Hg, aliskiren 150 mg -5.6/-2.9 mm Hg, aliskiren 300 mg -7.9/-4.8, aliskiren 600 mg -11.4/-6.6 mm Hg.

Aliskiren has no effect on blood pressure variability. No data was available to assess the effect of aliskiren on heart rate and pulse pressure. This review found weak evidence that with short-term use, aliskiren does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects as compared to placebo.Authors' conclusions: Aliskiren has a dose-related blood pressure lowering effect better than placebo. This effect is similar to that determined for ACE inhibitors and ARBs.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"501","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension: a Cochrane systematic review (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["Musini, V.

Randomised controlled trials have been carried out to investigate the evidence for these agents.There is, for example, strong RCT evidence that thiazides reduce mortality and morbidity. Reserpine has been used as a second-line therapy in some of those trials. However, the dose-related blood pressure reduction with this agent is not known.Objectives: To investigate the dose-related effect of reserpine on blood pressure, heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse events.Search methods: The databases CENTRAL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were searched. We also traced citations in the reference sections of the retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Included studies were truly randomised controlled trials comparing reserpine monotherapy to placebo or no treatment in patients with primary hypertension.Data collection and analysis: Methods of randomization and concealment were assessed. Data on blood pressure reduction, heart rate,and withdrawal due to adverse effects were extracted and analysed.Main results: Four RCTs (N =237) were found that met the inclusion criteria. The overall pooled effect demonstrates a statistically significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in patients taking reserpine compared to placebo (WMD -7.92, 95% CI -14.05, -1.78). Due to significant heterogeneity across trials, a significant effect in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) could not be found. The SBP effects were achieved with 0.5 mg/day or greater. However, the dose-response pattern could not be determined because of the small number of trials. Data from the trial that investigated Rauwiloid against placebo was not combined with reserpine data from the remaining three trials. This is because Rauwiloid is a different alkaloid extract of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina and the dose used is not comparable to reserpine. None of the included trials reported withdrawals due to adverse effects.Authors' conclusions: Reserpine is effective in reducing SBP roughly to the same degree as other first-line antihypertensive drugs. However, we could not make definite conclusions regarding the dose-response pattern because of the small number of included trials. More RCTs are needed to assess the effects of reserpine on blood pressure and to determine the dose-related safety profile before the role of this drug in the treatment of primary hypertension can be established.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"256","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure response to changes in sodium and potassium intake: a metaregression analysis of randomised trials (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["Geleijnse, J.

Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.Objectives: To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.Selection criteria: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Main results: We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin in ibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.Authors' conclusions: This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"209","type":"report","title":"Calcium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Dickinson Heather, O.","Nicolson, Donald","Cook Julia, V.","Campbell, Fiona","Beyer Fiona, R.","Ford Gary, A.","Mason, James"],"date":"2006","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004639.pub2/abstract"],"number":"2","abstract":"Background: Metabolic studies suggest calcium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure. Some epidemiological studies reported people with a higher intake of calcium tend to have lower blood pressure. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reached conflicting conclusions about whether oral calcium supplementation can reduce blood pressure.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of oral calcium supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.Selection criteria: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs comparing oral calcium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ?8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ?140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ?85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or calcium supplementation was combined with other interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.Main results: We included 13 RCTs (n=485), with between eight and 15 weeks follow-up. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving calcium supplementation as compared to control had a statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference: -2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.5 to -0.6, I2 = 42%), but not DBP (mean difference: -0.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.1 to 0.4, I2 = 48%). Sub-group analyses indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of calcium or baseline blood pressure. Heterogeneity was reduced when poor quality trials were excluded. The one trial reporting adequate concealment of allocation and the one trial reporting adequate blinding yielded results consistent with the primary meta-analysis.Authors' conclusions: Due to poor quality of included trials and heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of causal association between calcium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of calcium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"515","type":"report","title":"Carvedilol versus metoprolol for primary hypertension: a systematic review (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects","authors":["Niu, X.

Furthermore, the enzyme system provides relative protection from tissue ischaemia and acidosis. The system could therefore be a target for pharmacologic intervention.Objectives: To systematically evaluate evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions directly targeting the creatine kinase system as compared to placebo control in adult patients with essential hypertension or cardiovascular disease.Search methods: Electronic databases searched: Medline (1950 - Feb 2011), Embase (up to Feb 2011), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 3, Aug 2009), Latin-American/Caribbean databank Lilacs; references from textbooks and reviews; contact with experts and pharmaceutical companies; and searching the Internet. There was no language restriction.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing creatine, creatine phosphate, or cyclocreatine (any route, dose or duration of treatment) with placebo; in adult patients with essential hypertension, heart failure, or myocardial infarction. We did not include papers on the short-term use of creatine during cardiac surgery.Data collection and analysis: The outcomes assessed were death, total myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal), hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, change in ejection fraction, and changes in diastolic and systolic blood pressure in mm Hg or as percent change.Main results: Full reports or abstracts from 1164 papers were reviewed, yielding 11 trials considering treatment with creatine or creatine analogues in 1474 patients with heart failure, ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction. No trial in patients with hypertension was identified. Eleven trials (1474 patients, 35 years or older) comparing add-on therapy of the creatine-based drug on standard treatment to placebo control in patients with heart failure (6 trials in 1226 / 1474 patients ), or acute myocardial infarction (4 trials in 220 / 1474 patients) or 1 in ischemic heart disease (28 / 1474 patients) were identified. The drugs used were either creatine, creatine phosphate (orally, intravenously, or intramuscular) or phosphocreatinine. In the trials considering heart failure all three different compounds were studied; creatine orally (Gordon 1995, Kuethe 2006), creatine phosphate via intravenous infusion (Ferraro 1996, Grazioli 1992), and phosphocreatinine orally (Carmenini 1994, Maggi 1990). In contrast, the acute myocardial infarction trials studied intravenous creatine phosphate only. In the ischemic heart disease trial (Pedone 1984) creatine phosphate was given twice daily through an intramuscular injection to outpatients and through an intravenous infusion to inpatients. The duration of the study intervention was shorter for the acute patients, from a two hour intravenous infusion of creatine phosphate in acute myocardial infarction (Ruda 1988, Samarenko 1987), to six months in patients with heart failure on oral phosphocreatinine therapy (Carmenini 1994). In the acute myocardial infarction patients the follow-up period varied from the acute treatment period (Ruda 1988) to 28 days after start of the symptoms (Samarenko 1987) or end of the hospitalization period (Zochowski 1994). In the other trials there was no follow-up after discontinuation of treatment, except for Gordon 1995 which followed the patients until four days after stopping the intervention.Only two out of four trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction reported mortality outcomes, with no significant effect of creatine or creatine analogues (RR 0.73, CI: 0.22 - 2.45). In addition, there was no significance on the progression of myocardial infarction or improvement on ejection fraction. The main effect of the interventions seems to be on improvement of dysrhythmia.Authors' conclusions: This review found inconclusive evidence to decide on the use of creatine analogues in clinical practice. In particular, it is ot clear whether there is an effect on mortality, progression of myocardial infarction and ejection fraction, while there is some evidence that dysrhythmia and dyspnoea might improve. However, it is not clear which analogue, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy is most effective. Moreover, given the small sample size of the discussed trials and the heterogeneity of the population included in these reports, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"411","type":"report","title":"Cupping for hypertension: a systematic review (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Hypertension","authors":["Lee, M.

Epidemiological studies suggest that cocoa rich products reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Flavanols found in cocoa have been shown to increase the formation of endothelial nitric oxide which promotes vasodilation and therefore blood pressure reduction. Previous meta-analyses have shown that cocoa-rich foods may reduce blood pressure. Recently additional trials had conflicting results.Objectives: To determine the effect of flavanol-rich chocolate or cocoa products on blood pressure in people with or without hypertension.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases from inception to November 2011: Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. In addition we searched international trial registries, and the reference lists of review articles and included trials.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating the effects of chocolate or cocoa products on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults for a minimum of two weeks duration.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in each trial in consultation with a third author. Random effects meta-analyses on all studies fitting the inclusion criteria were conducted using Review Manager version 5.1 and Stata version 12. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regression analysis of several variables including dosage of flavanol content (total or monomers) in chocolate or cocoa products, blinding, baseline blood pressure, theobromine content, sugar content, body-mass-index (BMI), duration and age.Main results: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses of the 20 studies involving 856 mainly healthy participants revealed a statistically significant blood pressure reducing effect of flavanol-rich cocoa products compared with control in short-term trials of 2-18 weeks duration: Mean difference SBP (95%CI): -2.77 (-4.72, -0.82) mm Hg, p=0.005, n=20; mean difference DBP (95%CI): - 2.20 (-3.46, -0.93) mm Hg, p=0.006, n=19 available for DBP.Trials provided participants with 30-1080 mg of flavanols (mean=545.5 mg) in 3.6-105 g of cocoa products per day in the active intervention group. In half of the trials (n=10) the active group consumed 500-750 mg of flavanols per day. The control group received either a flavanol-free product (n=12) or a low-flavanol containing cocoa powder (6.4 and 41 mg flavanols, n=8). Subgroup meta-analysis of trials with a flavanol-free control group revealed a significant blood pressure reducing effect, in contrast to trials using a low-flavanol product in the control group. This analysis may have been confounded by trial duration and the level of blinding of participants.Trial duration was short (mean 4.4 weeks, range 2-8 weeks, n=19, and one trial of 18 weeks). A significant blood pressure reducing effect was evident in trials of 2 weeks duration (n=9), but not in trials of >2 weeks duration (n=11). It is important to note that seven out of the nine trials (78%) of 2 weeks duration also had a flavanol-free control group. Therefore, subgroup analysis by duration might be confounded by flavanol dosage used in the control groups, and the level of blinding of participants.Adverse effects including gastrointestinal complaints and distaste of the trial product were reported by 5% of patients in the active cocoa intervention group and 1% of patients in the control groups.Authors' conclusions: Flavanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products may have a small but statistically significant effect in lowering blood pressure by 2-3 mm Hg in the short term.Our findings are limited by the heterogeneity between trials, which was explored by univariate meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Subgroup meta-analysis of trials using a flavanol-free control group revealed a significant bl od pressure reducing effect of cocoa, whereas analysis of trials using a low-flavanol control product did not. While it appears that shorter trials of 2 weeks duration were more effective, analysis may be confounded by type of control and unblinding of participants, as the majority of 2-week trials also used a flavanol-free control and unblinding of participants. Results of these and other subgroup analyses based on, for example, age of participants, should be interpreted with caution and need to be confirmed or refuted in trials using direct randomized comparison.Long-term trials investigating the effect of cocoa products are needed to determine whether or not blood pressure is reduced on a chronic basis by daily ingestion of cocoa. Furthermore, long-term trials investigating the effect of cocoa on clinical outcomes are also needed to assess whether cocoa has an effect on cardiovascular events and to assess potential adverse effects associated with chronic ingestion of cocoa products.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"203","type":"report","title":"Effect of cocoa products on blood pressure: systematic review and meta-analysis (Structured abstract)","journal":"American Journal of Hypertension","authors":["Desch, S.","Schmidt, J.","Kobler, D.","Sonnabend, M.","Eitel, I.","Sareban, M.","Rahimi, K.","Schuler, G.","Thiele, H."],"date":"2010","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12010000691/frame.html"],"pages":"97-103","volume":"23","number":"1","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"741","type":"report","title":"Effect of dietary fiber intake on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of Hypertension","authors":["Whelton, S.

A recent meta-analysis by Graudal implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with BP reduction. However, Graudal's meta-analysis included a large number of very short-term trials with a large change in salt intake, and such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations for a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake. We have updated our Cochrane meta-analysis. Objectives: To assess (1) the effect of a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake (i.e. of public health relevance) on BP and whether there was a dose-response relationship; (2) the effect on BP by sex and ethnic group; (3) the effect on plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides.Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and reference list of relevant articles.Selection criteria: We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and duration of at least 4 weeks.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed.Main results: Thirty-four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt vs usual salt) was -75 mmol/24-h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/d salt), the mean change in BP was -4.18 mmHg (95% CI: -5.18 to -3.18, I 2=75%) for systolic and -2.06 mmHg (95% CI: -2.67 to -1.45, I 2=68%) for diastolic BP. Meta-regression showed that age, ethnic group, BP status (hypertensive or normotensive) and the change in 24-h urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 5.8 mmHg (95%CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and the change in 24-h urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta-analysis by subgroup showed that, in hypertensives, the mean effect was -5.39 mmHg (95% CI: -6.62 to -4.15, I 2=61%) for systolic and -2.82 mmHg (95% CI: -3.54 to -2.11, I 2=52%) for diastolic BP. In normotensives, the mean effect was -2.42 mmHg (95% CI: -3.56 to -1.29, I 2=66%) for systolic and -1.00 mmHg (95% CI: -1.85 to -0.15, I 2=66%) for diastolic BP. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic BP was significant in both whites and blacks, men and women. Meta-analysis of hormone and lipid data showed that the mean effect was 0.26 ng/ml/hr (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.36, I 2=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/l (95% CI: 44.92 to 101.48, I 2=62%) for aldosterone, 31.67 pg/ml (95% CI: 6.57 to 56.77, I 2=5%) for noradrenaline, 6.70 pg/ml (95% CI: -0.25 to 13.64, I 2=12%) for adrenaline, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.11, I 2=0%) for cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.12, I 2=0%) for LDL, -0.02 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.01, I 2=16%) for HDL, and 0.04 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.09, I 2=0%) for triglycerides.Authors' conclusions: A modest reduction in salt intake for 4 or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group. With salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. There is no significant change in lipid levels. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates a significant association between the reduction n 24-h urinary sodium and the fall in systolic BP, indicating the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"42","type":"report","title":"Effect of lower sodium intake on health: systematic review and meta-analyses (Structured abstract)","journal":"Bmj","authors":["Aburto, N.

The morning surge in blood pressure is known to increase the risk of myocardial events in the first several hours post awakening. A systematic review of the administration-time-related-effects of evening versus morning dosing regimen of antihypertensive drugs in the management of patients with primary hypertension has not been conducted.Objectives: To evaluate the administration-time-related-effects of antihypertensive drugs administered as once daily monotherapy in the evening versus morning administration regimen on all cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and reduction of blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension.Search methods: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL on Ovid (4th Quarter 2009), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to October 2009), EMBASE (1974 to October 2009), the Chinese Biomedical literature database (1978 to 2009) and the reference lists of relevant articles. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing the administration-time-related effects of evening with morning dosing monotherapy regimens in patients with primary hypertension were included. Patients with known secondary hypertension, shift workers or white coat hypertension were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Data synthesis and analysis were done using RevMan 5.1. Random effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted.Main results: 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 1,993 patients with primary hypertension met the inclusion criteria for this review - ACEIs (5 trials), CCBs (7 trials), ARBs (6 trials), diuretics (2 trials), alpha-blockers (1 trial), and beta-blockers (1 trial). Meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity across trials.No RCT reported on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and serious adverse events.There was no statistically significant difference for overall adverse events (RR=0.78, 95%CI: 0.37 to 1.65) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR=0.53, 95%CI: 0.26 to 1.07).No significant differences were noted for morning SBP (-1.62 mm Hg, 95% CI: -4.19 to 0.95) and morning DBP (-1.21 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.28 to 0.86); but 24-hour BP (SBP: -1.71 mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.78 to -0.65; DBP: -1.38 mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.13 to -0.62) showed a statistically significant difference.Authors' conclusions: No RCT reported on clinically relevant outcome measures - all cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and morbidity. There were no significant differences in overall adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events among the evening versus morning dosing regimens. In terms of BP lowering efficacy, for 24-hour SBP and DBP, the data suggests that better blood pressure control was achieved with bedtime dosing than morning administration of antihypertensive medication, the clinical significance of which is not known.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"101","type":"report","title":"The evidence for treating hypertension in older people with dementia: a systematic review (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["Beishon, L.

Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease world wide and new blood pressure reducing lifestyle interventions, such as fermented milk, would be of great importance.Objectives: To investigate whether fermented milk or similar products produced by lactobacilli fermentation of milk proteins has any blood pressure lowering effect in humans when compared to no treatment or placebo.Search methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), English language databases, including MEDLINE (1966-2011), EMBASE (1974-2011), Cochrane Complementary Medicine Trials Register, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985-2011), Food science and technology abstracts (1969-2011).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials; cross over and parallel studies evaluating the effect on blood pressure of fermented milk in humans with an intervention period of 4 weeks or longer.Data collection and analysis: Data was extracted individually by two authors, afterwards agreement had to be obtained before imputation in the review.Main results: A modest overall effect of fermented milk on SBP was found (MD -2.45; 95% CI -4.30 to -0.60), no effect was evident on DBP (MD -0.67; 95% CI -1.48, 0.14).Authors' conclusions: The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure. Despite the positive effect on SBP the authors conclude, for several reasons, that fermented milk has no effect on blood pressure. The effect found was very modest and only on SBP, the included studies were very heterogeneous and several with weak methodology. Finally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses could not reproduce the antihypertensive effect. The results do not give notion to the use of fermented milk as treatment for hypertension or as a lifestyle intervention for pre-hypertension nor would it influence population blood pressure.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"754","type":"report","title":"First-line drugs for hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Wright James, M.","Musini Vijaya, M."],"date":"2009","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001841.pub2/abstract"],"number":"3","abstract":"Background: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.Objectives: Primary objective: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).Search methods: Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.Selection criteria: Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP >140/90 mmHg at baseline.Data collection and analysis: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.Main results: Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.Authors' conclusions: First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"773","type":"report","title":"First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Xue, Hao","Lu, Zhuang","Tang Wen, Lu","Pang Lu, Wei","Wang Gan, Mi","Wong Gavin, W.

Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.Selection criteria: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (?130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.Main results: We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence.Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR).Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence).Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 particip nts in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence).Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7% ). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence).Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.Authors' conclusions: We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase"]},{"recNumber":"653","type":"report","title":"Garlic for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Stabler Sarah, N.","Tejani Aaron, M.","Huynh, Fong","Fowkes, Claire"],"date":"2012","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007653.pub2/abstract"],"number":"8","abstract":"Background: Garlic is widely used by patients for its blood pressure lowering effects. A meta-analysis published in 2008 concluded that garlic consumption lowers blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive patients. Therefore, it is important to review the currently available evidence to determine whether garlic may also have a beneficial role in the reduction of cardiovascular events and mortality rates in patients with hypertension.Objectives: To determine whether the use of garlic as monotherapy, in hypertensive patients, lowers the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to placebo.Search methods: A systematic search for trials was conducted in the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AGRICOLA, AMED, and CINAHL up to November 2011. A hand search of reference lists of identified reviews was conducted. Experts in the area were also contacted to identify trials not found in the electronic search. Clinicaltrials.gov was searched for ongoing trials.Selection criteria: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of any garlic preparation versus placebo for the treatment of hypertension were included.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the risk of bias tool. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.Main results: The search identified two randomized controlled trials for inclusion. One trial included 47 hypertensive patients and showed that garlic significantly reduces mean supine systolic blood pressure by 12 mmHg (95% CI 0.56 to 23.44 mmHg, p=0.04) and mean supine diastolic blood pressure by 9 mmHg (95% CI 2.49 to 15.51 mmHg, p=0.007) versus placebo. The authors state that garlic was \"free from side effects\" and that no serious side effects were reported. There were 3 cases \"where a slight smell of garlic was noted.\"The second trial could not be meta-analysed as they did not report the number of people randomized to each treatment group. They did report that 200 mg of garlic powder given three times daily, in addition to hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene baseline therapy, produced a mean reduction of systolic blood pressure by 10-11 mmHg and of diastolic blood pressure by 6-8 mmHg versus placebo.Neither trial reported clinical outcomes and insufficient data was provided on adverse events.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to determine if garlic provides a therapeutic advantage versus placebo in terms of reducing the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients diagnosed with hypertension. There is also insufficient evidence to determine the difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between patients treated with garlic or placebo.Based on 2 trials in 87 hypertensive patients, it appears that garlic reduces mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 10-12 mmHg and 6-9 mmHg, respectively, over and above the effect of placebo but the confidence intervals for these effect estimates are not precise and this difference in blood pressure reduction falls within the known variability in blood pressure measurements. This makes it difficult to determine the true impact of garlic on lowering blood pressure.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"768","type":"report","title":"Ginkgo biloba extract for essential hypertension: a systematic review (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects","authors":["Xiong, X.

Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator which has been used for the treatment of hypertension since the 1950's. Although it has largely been replaced by newer antihypertensive drugs with more acceptable tolerability profiles, hydralazine is still widely used in developing countries due to its lower cost. A review of its relative effectiveness compared to placebo on surrogate and clinical outcomes is justified.Objectives: To quantify the effect of hydralazine compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarctions, strokes, withdrawals due to adverse effects and blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension.Search methods: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948-August 2011), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2009) and EMBASE (1980-August 2011). Bibliographic citations from retrieved studies were also reviewed. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected RCTs studying the effect of oral hydralazine compared to oral placebo in patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary hypertension or gestational hypertension.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the risk of bias tool. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.Main results: The search strategy did not yield any randomized controlled trials comparing hydralazine to placebo for inclusion in this review. There is insufficient evidence to conclude on the effects of hydralazine versus placebo on mortality, morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse effects, serious adverse events, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Some of the adverse effects related to hydralazine that have been reported in the literature include reflex tachycardia, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and a lupus-like syndrome.Authors' conclusions: Hydralazine may reduce blood pressure when compared to placebo in patients with primary hypertension, however this data is based on before and after studies, not RCTs. Furthermore, its effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"39","type":"report","title":"Impact of blood pressure telemonitoring on hypertension outcomes: a literature review (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Telemedicine and e-Health","authors":["AbuDagga, A.","Resnick, H.

The studies were conducted in nine countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to 60 months. Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8 per cent to 19.6 per cent. Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent. Complex interventions involving more than one technique increased adherence in eight out of 18 studies, ranging from 5 per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful.Authors' conclusions: Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy, although there is less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction.

To evaluate the effectiveness of reminders on improving the follow-up of patients with hypertension.Search methods: All-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) and Medline; and Embase from January 1980.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with hypertension that evaluated the following interventions: (1) self-monitoring (2) educational interventions directed to the patient (3) educational interventions directed to the health professional (4) health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care (5) organisational interventions that aimed to improve the delivery of care (6) appointment reminder systemsOutcomes assessed were: (1) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (2) control of blood pressure (3) proportion of patients followed up at clinicData collection and analysis: Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Handbook.Main results: 72 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included studies varied. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (WMD) -8.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.8 to -7.2 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -4.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.7 to -3.9 mmHg) for three strata of entry blood pressure, and all-cause mortality at five years follow-up (6.4% versus 7.8%, difference 1.4%) in a single large RCT- the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reduction in systolic blood pressure (WMD -2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.7 to -1.3 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2 mmHg). RCTs of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way forward, with the majority of RCTs being associated with improved blood pressure control and mean SBP and DBP but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems also require further evaluation due to heterogeneity and small trial numbers, but the majority of trials increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow-up (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73).Authors' conclusions: Family practices and community-based clinics need to have an organized system of regular follow-up and review of their hypertensive patients. Antihypertensive drug therapy should be implemented by means of a vigorous stepped care approach when patients do not reach target blood pressure levels. Self-monitoring and appointment reminders may be useful adjuncts to the above strategies to improve blood pressure control but require further evaluation.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"755","type":"report","title":"Irbesartan for hypertensive patients with hyperuricaemia: a systematic review (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine","authors":["Wu, F.

Studies were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. In case of moderate or larger heterogeneity as measured by Higgins I2, a random effects model was used.Main results: Eight studies involving a total of 2100 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 45 to 66 years met our inclusion criteria. Mean treatment duration was 6 to 36 months. No study included mortality as a pre-defined outcome. One RCT evaluated the effects of dietary weight loss on a combined endpoint, consisting of the necessity of reinstating antihypertensive therapy and severe cardiovascular complications. In this RCT weight reducing diet lowered the endpoint, hazard ratio 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.87) compared to no diet. None of the studies evaluated adverse events as designated in our protocol. Blood pressure was reduced in patients assigned to weight loss diets as compared to controls: systolic blood pressure (SBP): weighted mean difference (WMD): -4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -7.2 to -1.8 mm Hg (3 of 8 studies included in analysis), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP): WMD -3.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.8 to -1.5 mm Hg (3 of 8 studies included in analysis). Patients' body weight was also reduced in dietary weight loss groups as compared to controls, WMD of -4.0 kg (95% CI: -4.8 to -3.2) (5 of 8 studies included in analysis). Two studies used withdrawal of antihypertensive medication as their primary outcome. Even though this was not considered a relevant outcome for this review, the results of these studies strengthen the finding of reduction of blood pressure by dietary weight loss interventions.Authors' conclusions: In patients with primary hypertension, weight loss diets reduced body weight and blood pressure, however the magnitude of the effects are uncertain as a result of the small number of patients and studies that could be included in the analyses. It is not known whether weight loss reduces mortality and morbidity.

Studies were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (p>0.1). Otherwise, we used the random effects method and investigated the cause of heterogeneity.Main results: After the updated literature search, the number of studies remained the same, with eight studies comparing orlistat or sibutramine to placebo fulfilling our inclusion criteria. No relevant studies investigating rimonabant for weight loss were identified. No study included mortality and cardiovascular morbidity as a pre-defined outcome. Incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher in orlistat treated vs. placebo treated patients. Most frequent side effects with sibutramine were dry mouth, constipation and headache. Patients assigned to weight loss diets, orlistat or sibutramine reduced their body weight more effectively than patients in the usual care/placebo groups. Blood pressure reduction in patients treated with orlistat was for systolic blood pressure (SBP): weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.9 mm Hg and for diastolic blood pressure (DBP): WMD -1.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.0 to -0.9 mm Hg.

In the same trials, orlistat reduced blood pressure and sibutramine increased blood pressure. No trials investigating rimonabant in people with elevated blood pressure could be included. Long-term trials assessing the effect of orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant on mortality and morbidity are lacking. Rimonabant and sibutramine have been withdrawn from the market for the time being.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"331","type":"report","title":"Long-term effects of weight-reducing interventions in hypertensive patients: systematic review and meta-analysis (Structured abstract)","journal":"Archives of Internal Medicine","authors":["Horvath, K.","Jeitler, K.","Siering, U.","Stich, A.

Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of magnesium supplementation as treatment for primary hypertension in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.Selection criteria: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral magnesium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ?8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ?140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ?85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.Main results: Twelve RCTs (n=545) with eight to 26 weeks follow-up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving magnesium supplements as compared to control did not significantly reduce SBP (mean difference: -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5, I2=67%), but did statistically significantly reduce DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9, I2=47%). Sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality trials yielded similar results. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of magnesium, baseline blood pressure or the proportion of males among the participants.Authors' conclusions: In view of the poor quality of included trials and the heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"762","type":"report","title":"Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing telmisartan with losartan in the treatment of patients with hypertension (Structured abstract)","journal":"American Journal of Hypertension","authors":["Xi, G.

Methyldopa is a centrally acting antihypertensive agent, which was commonly used in the 1970's and 80's for blood pressure control. Its use at present has largely been replaced by antihypertensive drug classes with less side effects, but it is still used in developing countries due to its low cost. A review of its relative effectiveness compared to placebo on surrogate and clinical outcomes is justified.Objectives: To quantify the effect of methyldopa compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarctions, strokes, withdrawals due to adverse effects and blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension.Search methods: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1960-June 2009), MEDLINE (2005-June 2009), and EMBASE (2007-June 2009). Bibliographic citations from retrieved studies were also reviewed. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary hypertension or gestational hypertension.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the risk of bias tool. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5. Data for blood pressure were combined using the generic inverse variance method.Main results: Twelve trials (N=595) met the inclusion criteria for this review. None of these studies evaluated the effects of methyldopa compared to placebo on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Data for withdrawals due to adverse effects were not reported in a way that permitted meaningful meta-analysis. Data from six of the twelve trials (N=231) were combined to evaluate the blood pressure lowering effects of methyldopa compared to placebo. This meta-analysis shows that methyldopa at doses ranging from 500-2250 mg daily lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of 13 (95%CI 6-20) / 8 (95% CI 4-13) mmHg. Overall, the risk of bias was considered moderate.Authors' conclusions: Methyldopa lowers blood pressure to varying degrees compared to placebo for patients with primary hypertension. Its effect on clinical outcomes, however, remains uncertain.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"765","type":"report","title":"Moxibustion for essential hypertension (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Complementary Therapies in Medicine","authors":["Xiong, X.","Liu, W.","Yang, X.","Feng, B.","Wang, J."],"date":"2014","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12014015800/frame.html"],"pages":"187-195","volume":"22","number":"1","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"176","type":"report","title":"Nurse led interventions to improve control of blood pressure in people with hypertension: systematic review and meta-analysis (Structured abstract)","journal":"Bmj","authors":["Clark, C.

There is a paucity of data on the long-term sequelae of persistent hypertension in children, but it is known that children with hypertension have evidence of end organ damage and are at risk of hypertension into adulthood. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates. In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure, especially those with evidence of end organ damage at presentation or during follow-up. A systematic review of the effects of antihypertensive agents in children has not previously been conducted.Objectives: To determine the dose-related effects of different classes of antihypertensive medications, as monotherapy compared to placebo; as combination therapy compared to placebo or a single medication; or in comparisons of various doses within the same class, on systolic or diastolic blood pressure (or both) in children with hypertension.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October 2013), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to October 2013) and bibliographic citations.Selection criteria: The selection criteria were deliberately broad due to there being few clinical trials in children. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least two weeks duration comparing antihypertensive agents either as monotherapy or combination therapy with either placebo or another medication, or comparing different doses of the same medication, in children with hypertension. Hypertension was defined as an average (over a minimum of three readings) systolic or diastolic blood pressure (or both) on the 95th percentile or above for age, height and gender. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We summarised data, where possible, using a random-effects model. Formal assessment of heterogeneity was not possible because of insufficient data.Main results: A total of 21 trials evaluated antihypertensive medications of various drug classes in 3454 hypertensive children with periods of follow-up ranging from three to 24 weeks. There were five RCTs comparing an antihypertensive drug directly with placebo, 12 dose-finding trials, two trials comparing calcium channel blockers with angiotensin receptor blockers, one trial comparing a centrally acting alpha blocker with a diuretic and one trial comparing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker. No randomised trial was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on target end organ damage. The trials were of variable quality and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies.Among the angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan (one trial, n = 240), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.50 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.44 to -3.56) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.50 mmHg (95% CI -9.62 to -1.38) (low-quality evidence). High dose telmisartan (one trial, n = 76), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by -8.50 (95% CI -13.79 to -3.21) but not diastolic blood pressure (-4.80, 95% CI -9.50 to 0.10) (low-quality evidence). Beta blocker (metoprolol, one trial, n = 140), when compared with placebo , significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.20 mmHg (95% CI -8.12 to -0.28) but not diastolic blood pressure (-3.20 mmHg 95% CI -7.12 to 0.72) (low-quality evidence). Beta blocker/diuretic combination (Bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide, one trial, n = 94)when compared with placebo , did not result in a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-4.0 mmHg, 95% CI -8.99 to -0.19) but did have an effect on diastolic blood pressure (-4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -8.26 to -0.74) (low-quality evidence). Calcium channel blocker (extended-release felodipine,one trial, n = 133) was not effective in reducing systolic blood pressure (-0.62 mmHg, 95% CI -2.97 to 1.73) or diastolic blood pressure (-1.86 mmHg, 95% CI -5.23 to 1.51) when compared with placebo. Further, there was no consistent dose response observed among any of the drug classes. The adverse events associated with the antihypertensive agents were mostly minor and included headaches, dizziness and upper respiratory infections.Authors' conclusions: Overall, there are sparse data informing the use of antihypertensive agents in children, with outcomes reported limited to blood pressure and not end organ damage. The most data are available for candesartan, for which there is low-quality evidence of a modest lowering effect on blood pressure. We did not find evidence of a consistent dose response relationship for escalating doses of angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. All agents appear safe, at least in the short term.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"207","type":"report","title":"Potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Dickinson Heather, O.","Nicolson, Donald","Campbell, Fiona","Beyer Fiona, R.","Mason, James"],"date":"2006","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004641.pub2/abstract"],"number":"3","abstract":"Background: Epidemiological evidence on the effects of potassium on blood pressure is inconsistent.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of potassium supplementation on health outcomes and blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.Selection criteria: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral potassium supplements with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up >=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=85 mmHg); 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or potassium supplementation was combined with other interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.Main results: Six RCT's (n=483), with 8-16 weeks follow-up, met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of five trials (n=425) with adequate data indicated that potassium supplementation compared to control resulted in a large but statistically non-significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: -11.2, 95% CI: -25.2 to 2.7) and DBP (mean difference: -5.0, 95% CI: -12.5 to 2.4). The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by potassium dose, quality of trials or baseline blood pressure.Excluding one trial in an African population with very high baseline blood pressure resulted in smaller overall reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.9, 95% CI: -8.6 to 0.8; DBP mean difference: -1.5, 95% CI: -6.2 to 3.1). Further sensitivity analysis restricted to two high quality trials (n=138) also found non-significant reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -7.1, 95% CI: -19.9 to 5.7; DBP mean difference: -5.5, 95% CI: -14.5 to 3.5).Authors' conclusions: Potassium supplementation has no statistically significant effect on blood pressure. Due to small number of participants in the two high quality trials, the short duration of follow-up, and the unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the evidence about the effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure is not conclusive. Further high quality RCTs of longer duration are required to clarify whether potassium supplementation can reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"111","type":"report","title":"Potassium treatment for hypertension in patients with high salt intake: a meta-analysis (Provisional abstract)","journal":"International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","authors":["Bommel, E.","Cleophas, T."],"date":"2012","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12012036804/frame.html"],"pages":"478-482","volume":"50","number":"7","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"141","type":"report","title":"The potency of team-based care interventions for hypertension: a meta-analysis (Structured abstract)","journal":"Archives of Internal Medicine","authors":["Carter, B.

To assess the long-term effects of advice and salt substitution, aimed at reducing dietary salt, on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.2. To investigate whether a reduction in blood pressure is an explanatory factor in the effect of such dietary interventions on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.Search methods: We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to April week 3 2013), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 30 April 2013) and CINAHL (EBSCO, inception to 1 April 2013) and last ran these on 1 May 2013. We also checked the references of included studies and reviews. We applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Trials fulfilled the following criteria: (1) randomised, with follow-up of at least six months, (2) the intervention was reduced dietary salt (through advice to reduce salt intake or low-sodium salt substitution), (3) participants were adults and (4) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data were available. Two review authors independently assessed whether studies met these criteria.Data collection and analysis: A single author extracted data and assessed study validity, and a second author checked this. We contacted trial authors where possible to obtain missing information. We extracted events and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Main results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria: three in normotensives (n = 3518) and five in hypertensives or mixed populations of normo- and hypertensives (n = 3766). End of trial follow-up ranged from six to 36 months and the longest observational follow-up (after trial end) was 12.7 years.The risk ratios (RR) for all-cause mortality in normotensives were imprecise and showed no evidence of reduction (end of trial RR 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.12, 60 deaths; longest follow-up RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40, 79 deaths n=3518) or in hypertensives (end of trial RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15, 565 deaths; longest follow-up RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.14, 674 deaths n=3085). There was weak evidence of benefit for cardiovascular mortality (hypertensives: end of trial RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.01, 106 events n=2656) and for cardiovascular events (hypertensives: end of trial RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.01, 194 events, four studies, n = 3397; normotensives: at longest follow-up RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.20, 200 events; hypertensives: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02, 192 events; pooled analysis of six trials RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95, n = 5912). These findings were driven by one trial among retirement home residents that reduced salt intake in the kitchens of the homes, thereby not requiring individual behaviour change.Advice to reduce salt showed small reductions in systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -1.15 mmHg, 95% CI -2.32 to 0.02 n=2079) and diastolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mmHg, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.23 n=2079) in normotensives and greater reductions in systolic blood pressure in hypertensives (MD -4.14 mmHg, 95% CI -5.84 to -2.43 n=675), but no difference in diastolic blood pressure (MD -3.74 mmHg, 95% CI -8.41 to 0.93 n=675).Overall many of the trials failed to report sufficient detail to assess their potential risk of bias. Health-related quality of life was assessed in one trial in normotensives, which reported significant improvements in well-being but no data were presented.Authors' conclusions: Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Our estimates of the clinical benefits from advice to reduce dietary salt are imprecise, but are larger than would be predicted from the small blood pressure reductio s achieved. Further well-powered studies would be needed to obtain more precise estimates. Our findings do not support individual dietary advice as a means of restricting salt intake. It is possible that alternative strategies that do not require individual behaviour change may be effective and merit further trials.","tags":["Cochrane","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"679","type":"report","title":"Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (Cochrane review) (Structured abstract)","journal":"American Journal of Hypertension","authors":["Taylor, R.

Controlling and lowering blood pressure have a significant benefit to the hypertensive patients because hypertension is a risk factor for stroke, heart disease and cardiovascular disease.

References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.Main results: Meta-analysis of the 5 cross-over studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95%CI:16.58-23.06,p<0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95%CI:4.8-8.69,p<0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the studies. There may be a dose response effect with spironolactone up to 50 mg/day, but the confidence intervals around the mean end-of-study blood pressure for doses ranging 25-500 mg/day all overlapped. In other words, it appears that doses >50mg/day do not produce further reductions in either SBP or DBP. One cross-over study found that spironolactone 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly change SBP or DBP compared to placebo, SBP: -9.9 (95%CI:-21.15,1.35); DBP -2.34 (95%CI:-7.92,3.06).Authors' conclusions: From the limited available evidence, spironolactone appears to lower blood pressure compared to placebo to a similar degree in patients with primary (essential) hypertension when doses of 100-500 mg/day are given. A dose of 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure, compared to placebo. Given the lack of a dose-response, coupled with a possible increased risk in adverse events with higher doses, doses of 25 to 100 mg/day are reasonable. There is no evidence of the effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients.","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"346","type":"report","title":"Stress-coping interventions in essential hypertension - Rapid report (Structured abstract)","journal":"Health Technology Assessment Database","authors":["IqwiG,"],"date":"2011","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clhta/articles/HTA-32013000382/frame.html"],"number":"4","tags":["Cochrane","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"760","type":"report","title":"Systematic review and meta analysis of randomized controlled trials on Tianmagouteng decoction in treatment of primary hypertension with liver Yang hyperactivity syndrome (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine","authors":["Wu, X.","Jiang, X."],"date":"2013","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12013022343/frame.html"],"pages":"15-18","volume":"33","number":"1","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"798","type":"report","title":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of aliskiren and angiotension receptor blockers in the management of essential hypertension (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System","authors":["Zheng, Z.","Shi, H.","Jia, J.","Li, D.","Lin, S."],"date":"2011","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12011003857/frame.html"],"pages":"102-112","volume":"12","number":"2","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"799","type":"report","title":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of candesartan and losartan in the management of essential hypertension (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System","authors":["Zheng, Z.","Shi, H.","Jia, J.","Li, D.","Lin, S."],"date":"2011","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12011005984/frame.html"],"pages":"365-374","volume":"12","number":"3","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"797","type":"report","title":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of telmisartan vs valsartan in the management of essential hypertension (Structured abstract)","journal":"Journal of Clinical Hypertension","authors":["Zheng, Z.","Lin, S.","Shi, H."],"date":"2010","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12010005902/frame.html"],"pages":"414-421","volume":"12","number":"6","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"190","type":"report","title":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of yoga for hypertension (Provisional abstract)","journal":"Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects","authors":["Cramer, H.","Haller, H.","Lauche, R.","Steckhan, N.","Michalsen, A.","Dobos, G."],"date":"2014","urls":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/cldare/articles/DARE-12014031243/frame.html"],"pages":"1146-1151","number":"4","tags":["Cochrane","DARE","Embase","Epistemonikos","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"218","type":"report","title":"Systematic review of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade in hypertension (Structured abstract)","journal":"Hypertension","authors":["Doulton, T.

Hypertension is a risk factor for PAD. Treatment for hypertension must be compatible with the symptoms of PAD. Controversy regarding the effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade for hypertension in patients with PAD has led many physicians to stop prescribing beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. Little is known about the effects of other classes of anti-hypertensive drugs in the presence of PAD. This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003.Objectives: To determine the effects of anti-hypertensive drugs in patients with both raised blood pressure and symptomatic PAD in terms of the rate of cardiovascular events and death, symptoms of claudication and critical leg ischaemia, and progression of atherosclerotic PAD as measured by ankle brachial index (ABI) changes and the need for revascularisation (reconstructive surgery or angioplasty) or amputation.Search methods: For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Register (last searched March 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 2).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one anti-hypertensive treatment against placebo or two anti-hypertensive medications against each other, with interventions lasting at least one month. Trials had to include patients with symptomatic PAD.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted by one author (DAL) and checked by the other (GYHL). Potentially eligible studies were excluded when the results presentation prevented adequate extraction of data and enquiries to authors did not yield raw data.Main results: Eight RCTs were included with a total of 3610 PAD patients. Four studies compared a recognised class of anti-hypertensive treatment with placebo and four studies compared two anti-hypertensive treatments with each other. Studies were not pooled due to the variation of the comparisons and the outcomes presented. Overall the quality of the available evidence was unclear, primarily as a result of a lack of detail in the study reports on the randomisation and blinding procedures and incomplete outcome data. Two studies compared angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors against placebo. In one study there was a significant reduction in the number of cardiovascular events in patients receiving ramipril (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; n = 1725). In the second trial using perindopril (n = 52) there was a marginal increase in claudication distance but no change in ABI and a reduction in maximum walking distance. A trial comparing the calcium antagonist verapamil versus placebo in patients undergoing angioplasty (n = 96) suggested that verapamil reduced restenosis (per cent diameter stenosis (± SD) 48.0% ± 11.5 versus 69.6% ± 12.2; P < 0.01), although this was not reflected in the maintenance of a high ABI (0.76 ± 0.10 versus 0.72 ± 0.08 for verapamil versus placebo). Another study (n = 80) demonstrated no significant difference in arterial intima-media thickness (IMT) in men receiving the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared to those receiving the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker doxazosin (-0.12 ± 0.14 mm and -0.08 ± 0.13 mm, respectively; P = 0.66). A study (n = 36) comparing telmisartan to placebo found a significant improvement in maximum walking distance at 12 months with telmisartan (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 191 m (157 to 226) versus 103 m (76 to 164); P < 0.001) but no differences in ABI (median (IQR) 0.60 (0.60 to 0.77) versus 0.52 (0.48 to 0.67)) or arterial IMT (median (IQR) 0.08 cm (0.07 to 0.09) versus 0.09 cm (0.08 to 0.10)). Two studies compared the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker nebivolol with either the thiazide diuretic HCTZ or with metoprolol. Both studies found no significant differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, or all-cause mortality between the anti-hypertensives.

Search terms were reported. Dissertations or masters theses were eligible for inclusion. The search was cross-referenced to identify additional studies.\rTwo reviewers independently assessed study quality using the Jadad scale of randomisation, blinding, withdrawals and drop-outs to give a maximum score of 5.\rTwo reviewers extracted changes in resting SBP and DBP with variances derived from standard deviations (SD) from the included trials; where change score standard deviations were missing they were calculated from pre- and post-standard deviation values. Disagreements were resolved through consensus.\rThree studies were included in the review (n=81, range 15 to 49). Study quality was 1 in two studies and 2 for one study; blinding was not undertaken in any of the studies. Publication bias was absent.Resting SBP (-13.4mmHg, 95% CI -15.3 to -11.0) and DBP (-7.8mmHg, 95% BCI, -16.5 to -3.0) were significantly reduced in the isometric handgrip group compared with controls when random-effects models were used; heterogeneity was absent. Significant reductions for SBP and DBP were observed when fixed-effects models were used; significant heterogeneity was present for these comparisons. Removal of each study from the analysis yielded significant reductions for SBP and DBP that ranged from -3.3 to -10.3mmHg.\rIsometric handgrip exercise was efficacious for reducing resting SBP and DBP in adults. The small number of studies gave the findings limited generalisability.\rThis review addressed a clear question and was supported by appropriate inclusion criteria. Adequate attempts were made to identify relevant studies without language restrictions, which reduced potential for language and publication biases. The likelihood of publication bias was assessed and found to be absent, but this was based on only a small number of studies. Two reviewers independently undertook trial selection, data extraction and validity assessment, which reduced potential for reviewer bias and error. Validity was assessed with published criteria; all studies were of poor quality. It appeared that appropriate methods were used to pool the trials. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed. The authors acknowledged that the generalisability of the findings was limited given the small number of studies included. This was a well-conducted review. The authors' conclusions appeared to reflect the limited available evidence. However, in light of the small number of included studies, all of which were of poor quality, the authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.\rPractice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that large RCTs with multiple arms that compared a separate isometric handgrip group with other lifestyle interventions (such as relaxation therapy, alcohol restriction, sodium restriction) were required, as were studies that assessed the effects of isometric handgrip exercise in combination with lifestyle interventions for lowering of blood pressure. Such studies should utilise intention-to-treat analysis, report drop-outs adequately and use evaluations where the assessor is blinded.","tags":["DARE","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"473","type":"report","title":"Effect of probiotics on blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials","journal":"Hypertension","authors":["Khalesi, S.","Sun, J.","Buys, N.","Jayasinghe, R."],"date":"2014","urls":["http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=12014046958"],"pages":"897-903","volume":"64","number":"4","tags":["DARE","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"555","type":"report","title":"Tolerability and effectiveness of (S)-amlodipine compared with racemic amlodipine in hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis","journal":"Current Therapeutic Research","authors":["Liu, F.","Qiu, M.","Zhai, S.

Google, a clinical trials registry and reference lists of included articles were used to search for further studies. Two drug companies were contacted about unpublished trials.\rStudy validity was assessed using a modified Jadad scale that assessed randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and description of withdrawals. The maximum possible score was 7. Scores from zero to 3 were classed as low quality. Scores of 4 to 7 were considered high quality.Two reviewers independently assessed validity. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or referral to a third reviewer.\rNumbers of participants were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and risk differences (RD) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) were calculated for continuous outcomes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or referral to a third reviewer. Authors were contacted for clarification of missing data.\rFifteen trials were included (2,086 participants, range 44 to 524). Twelve trials were classed as low quality (did not report the randomisation process or allocation concealment, blinding was not used or follow-up was not conducted). Three trials were classed as high quality. There were some discrepancies between the text and figures in the paper; these results were taken from the text.Antihypertensive effects: Decreases in blood pressure after four, six, eight, 32 and 40 weeks of treatment were not significantly different between (S)-amlodipine and racemic amlodipine. No significant differences were seen at four and eight weeks when only high-quality trials were included in the analysis. Funnel plots indicated some evidence of publication bias at four and eight weeks, but the numbers of trials on each plot were small.Changes in heart rate: After four weeks of treatment (S)-amlodipine was associated with a smaller change in heart rate compared with racemic amlodipine (MD -0.99, 95% CI -1.70 to -0.28; four trials with I2=0%). There was no difference after eight weeks. No significant difference between treatments was seen in the single high-quality trial at four and eight weeks.Adverse events: Fewer people experienced an adverse event with (S)-amlodipine compared with racemic amlodipine (RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; 13 trials with I2=0%). When only the two high-quality trials were included no difference was seen. Incidence of oedema was significantly lower with (S)-amlodipine than with racemic amlodipine (RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; 13 trials with I2=0%). When only the two high-quality trials were included no difference was seen. There was some evidence of publication bias for oedema. One high-quality trial found a significant increase in aspartate and alanine aminotransferase with (S)-amlodipine compared with racemic amlodipine (RD 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; error in the paper's results). There were no differences between treatments for 13 other types of adverse events including flushing and headache.\rAccording to limited evidence there were no significant differences between (S)-amlodipine 2.5mg and racemic amlodipine 5mg in controlling blood pressure. (S)-amlodipine was associated with significantly less oedema than racemic amlodipine, but this was not observed when only high-quality studies were analysed.\rThis review specified study inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and outcomes. Several databases were searched. Efforts were made to locate unpublished studies. It was unclear whether there were any language restrictions. The authors commented that there were few studies in languages other than Chinese. Study selection, validity assessment and data extraction were performed in duplicate. There were some inconsistencies in the reporting of results: fixed-effect results were reported where the methods say that random-effects models were used and some results shown as statistically significant on plots were reported in the text as non-significant. Reporting separate results for all trials and only those of high quality was a strength. This review was well-conducted but, as the authors suggested, the results should be treated with caution due to the small number of high-quality studies.\rPractice: The authors did not state any implications for practice. Research: The authors stated that more long-term high-quality RCTs were needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of (S)-amlodipine and racemic amlodipine.","tags":["DARE","Epistemonikos","PubMed Health","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"556","type":"report","title":"Effect of aldosterone antagonists on blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension: a meta-analysis","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["Liu, G.","Zheng, X.

Studies that only evaluated supplements of tea or cocoa ingredients, concomitant vitamin supplements or polyphenol-rich foods, or used other dietary treatments combined with tea or cocoa were excluded.The included cocoa studies compared dark or high-flavonoid chocolate containing between 213 and 500 mg of polyphenols with polyphenol-free white chocolate, low-flavonoid chocolate or cocoa butter chocolate. The energy values contained in the chocolate ranged from 240 to 544 kcal per day. All but one of the included tea studies assessed black tea (a minimum of 5 or 6 cups per day or containing 1,350 mg polyphenols); the remaining study assessed green tea. Water was the most common control used. Other controls used were: no tea; water with added caffeine matched to intervention caffeine levels; and water, milk and sugar with caffeine matched to intervention caffeine levels. The median duration was 2 weeks for the cocoa studies and 4 weeks for the tea studies.\rStudies of normotensive or hypertensive adults (aged 18 years or older) were eligible for inclusion. In the included studies, 34% of participants in the cocoa studies and 48.5% of participants in the tea studies had hypertension or high-normal blood-pressure. Most of the participants in the included studies (63.9% in the cocoa studies and 70.7% in the tea studies) were male. In only one of the included studies were any participants taking medication (aspirin plus antihypertensive drugs).\rStudies that reported means (or differences between means) and standard deviations (SDs) or 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of systolic and diastolic blood-pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) at baseline and post-treatment were eligible for inclusion.\rCrossover and parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 10 or more participants were eligible for inclusion.\rMEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and the Science Citation Index were searched from 1966 to October 2006, in addition to the Cochrane CENTRAL Register; the search terms were reported. No language restrictions were applied. The reference lists from original and review articles were also screened. Only studies published as full articles were included.\rTwo reviewers independently assessed validity using the 11-item Jadad scale. Any disagreements were resolved through consensus. The maximum possible score was 13 points. Studies scoring more than 9 points were considered to be good quality; studies scoring 9 or fewer points were considered to be poor quality.\rThe authors did not state how the papers were selected for the review, or how many reviewers performed the selection.\rTwo reviewers independently extracted the data and resolved any disagreements through consensus.For each study, changes in the mean (plus SD) were extracted for SBP and DBP. If the studies did not report SDs these were estimated using reported methods. Where possible, data from the crossover studies were analysed as paired data; otherwise, changes were input using the methods employed for the parallel-group studies.\rPooled mean differences between treatments were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and the Egger regression test.\rStatistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic and the I-squared statistic. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of excluding individual studies and to examine the effect of using different values (0 and 1 instead of 0.68 used in the main analyses) for the correlation coefficient in pooled estimates.\rTen RCTs (n=516) were included. Five of the RCTs (n=173) evaluated cocoa intake and the other five (n=343) evaluated tea intake.The quality scores ranged from 8 to 10 out of 13, with half of the studies being assessed as good quality. Methodological problems included lack of reporting of randomisation method, lack of assessment of adverse effects and no prior power estimation.Cocoa was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SBP (-4.7 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.6, -1.8, p=0.002) and DBP (-2.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.8, -0.8, p=0.006) compared with a cocoa-free control. Significant heterogeneity between the studies was found for SBP and DBP (p<0.001; I-squared 87.6%). Two studies appeared to be responsible for the heterogeneity and excluding these studies made little difference to the results.There was no statistically significant difference between tea and no tea for either SBP (0.4 mmHg, 95% CI: -1.3, 2.2, p=0.63) or DBP (-0.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -1.5, 0.4, p=0.38). No significant heterogeneity was found.Results from the meta-analyses were similar after excluding each study in turn.There was no evidence for publication bias from the funnel plots or Egger's test.\rCocoa-rich foods may reduce blood-pressure but tea intake appears to have no effect.\rThe review question was clear in terms of the study design, participants, intervention and outcomes. Several relevant sources were searched and attempts were made to minimise language but not publication bias. The potential for publication bias was assessed and no evidence of it was found; however, this was based on only a few studies with small sample sizes and so the potential for publication bias cannot be ruled out. Methods were used to minimise reviewer error and bias in the validity assessment and data extraction, but it was not clear whether similar steps were taken at the study selection stage. Study quality was assessed using an aggregated quality scoring system but details of the individual components were not reported in full, which limited the evaluation of study validity.The study synthesis appears appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed and the studies responsible for significant heterogeneity in the meta-analyses were identified; however, the reasons for such differences were not explicitly discussed. The authors acknowledged that the evidence in favour of cocoa reducing blood- pressure is based on only a few studies of short duration and small sample size, showing inconsistent results. The authors' cautious conclusion appears appropriate in view of the limited evidence available.\rPractice: The authors stated that any dietary advice based on the review findings must include a discussion of the high sugar, fat and calorie content of most cocoa products.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.","tags":["DARE","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"950","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure response to calcium supplementation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["van Mierlo, L.

Where stated, the duration of tai chi ranged from 20 days to 35 years.\rStudies of patients with chronic conditions were eligible for inclusion. The characteristics of the participants were generally not described. Where reported, the participants included older community dwellers; patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or hypertension; low-risk patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery; healthy young adults; low-activity adults; children; and older people with dementia.\rStudies that reported outcome data were eligible for inclusion. Reasons for the exclusion of some identified studies included the use of measures that lacked validity and had not been tested in the study population, and inadequate outcomes. The included studies assessed balance-related outcomes, falls, musculoskeletal outcomes, blood-pressure, cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, psychological response, endocrine and immune systems-related outcomes, and other outcomes (including self-efficacy, measures of blood flow and nightmares).\rRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (non-RCTs) and observational studies were eligible for inclusion.\rMEDLINE (1966 to 2002), SPORTDiscus (1949 to 2000), Social Science Abstracts (1984 to 2000), HealthSTAR (1975 to 2000), PsycINFO (1887 to 2001), ERIC (1966 to 2001), AIDSLINE (1980 to 2000), Biological Abstracts (1980 to 2001), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to 2000), CINAHL (1982 to 2001) and Chinese Medical Database (1976 to 2000) were searched for studies reported in English or Chinese; the search terms were reported.\rThe studies were assessed for the following: a well-defined study question; explicit or appropriate eligibility criteria; proper allocation of the treatment groups; baseline comparability of the treatment groups; accounting for confounders; adequate description of the intervention and outcomes; blinded outcome assessment; valid outcome measurements and statistical methods; adequate follow-up; reporting of the drop-out rate; and conclusions supported by findings. Two reviewers assessed validity.\rThe authors did not state how the papers were selected for the review, or how many reviewers performed the selection.\rTwo reviewers extracted the data.\rThe studies were combined in a narrative, grouped by the patient's medical condition.\rDifferences between the studies were discussed with reference to study quality.\rForty-seven studies (n=2,762) were included: 9 RCTs (n=912), 23 non-RCTs (n=967) and 15 observational studies (n=883).Methodological problems with the studies included: lack of a control group; small sample size; unclear study design; inadequate description of the study population and type of t'ai chi; lack of a blinded outcome assessment; lack of randomisation; potential selection bias; lack of control for confounding factors; lack of standardised outcome measures, lack of accounting for losses to follow-up; and unclear statistical analysis.Balance and falls: 2 RCTs, 5 non-RCTs and 4 observational studies were identified (n=563). All 7 clinical trials (2 RCTs and 5 non-RCTs) found that 8 to 16 weeks of t'ai chi significantly improved balance, flexibility and strength, and reduced falls in older community dwellers. These results were supported by the results of the observational studies.Musculoskeletal: 1 RCT and 3 non-RCTs were identified (n=168). The RCT (people with osteoarthritis) reported a statistically significant improvement in symptoms, self-efficacy, tension and satisfaction with health status after 12 weeks of t'ai chi. One non-RCT (people with rheumatoid arthritis) found no significant difference in disease activity between 10 weeks of t'ai chi and control, another (older community dwellers) found that t'ai chi increased muscle strength and endurance of knee extensors, while the third (people with multiple sclerosis) reported increases in some measures of function and flexibility, vitality, social functioning and mental health.Hypertension: 2 RCTs and 2 non-RCTs were identified (n=401). All studies found that regular t'ai chi reduced the mean blood-pressure.Cardiovascular and respiratory systems: 8 non-RCTs and 9 observational studies were identified (n=768). Seven of the non-RCTs reported an improvement in cardiorespiratory function, clinical symptoms or health fitness with t'ai chi; the remaining non-RCTs reported no difference in comparison with Wing Chun. The positive effects reported in the non-RCTs were generally supported by the results from the observational studies.Psychological response: 3 RCTs and 3 non-RCTs were identified (n=568). Two RCTs (low activity older adults) found that t'ai chi for 16 weeks or 6 months improved measures of depression, psychological distress, well-being, life satisfaction and perceptions of health compared with control. One RCT (schoolchildren) reported a statistically significant improvement in perceived self-competence, visual-motor integration and anxiety with t'ai chi. Two non-RCTs found that t'ai chi improved mood and reduced stress and anxiety, and another (patients with dementia) found that reminiscence plus t'ai chi improved insight.Endocrine and immune system: 1 non-RCT and 1 observational study were identified (n=158). Both studies reported a higher number of circulating T-cells in elderly people practicing t'ai chi compared with controls.Other: 1 RCT, 1 non-RCT and 1 observational study were identified (n=163). The RCT (older adults) reported a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy with 6 months of t'ai chi. The non-RCT (young people) reported a statistically significant decrease in nightmares with 20 days of t'ai chi. The observational study reported an increased cutaneous microcircularity function during t'ai chi exercise.\rT'ai chi appeared to have physiological and psychosocial benefits, appeared to be safe, and helped balance control, flexibility and cardiovascular fitness in older patients with chronic medical conditions. However, the studies were generally of a poor quality and limitations prevented firm conclusions from being drawn.\rThe review addressed a broad research question in terms of the study design, participants and outcomes. The inclusion criteria for participants (chronic medical condition) were not adhered to since at least one study with healthy people was included. Numerous databases were searched, some of which listed theses, dissertations and non-journal articles, thus reducing the potential for publication bias. Attempts were made to reduce language bias by including studies written in English and Chinese. The methods used to select studies and extract the data were not described, so it is not known whether any efforts were made to reduce errors and bias. Two reviewers assessed validity, but it was not reported whether they made their assessments independently. Validity was assessed using appropriate criteria.The participants in the included studies were rarely described, and it was unclear whether this deficiency arose from inadequate information in the primary studies or not. Given the variability among the studies, a narrative synthesis was appropriate, and the synthesis took account of study quality. The studies were generally of a poor quality. This, along with the lack of methodological details of the review process, means that the conclusions should be treated with caution. However, the review does seem to support the authors' conclusions about the limitations of the evidence and the need for well-designed studies.\rPractice: The authors stated that there is insufficient evidence to recommend t'ai chi for patients with chronic conditions.Research: The authors stated that there is a need for well-designed studies with defined study questions, adequate selection criteria, baseline similarity of the treatment groups, valid statistical methods, confounding factors taken into account, appropriate outcomes, and adequate follow-up.","tags":["DARE","TRIP"]},{"recNumber":"1040","type":"report","title":"Massage therapy for essential hypertension: a systematic review","journal":"Journal of Human Hypertension","authors":["Xiong, X.

Blood pressure self-monitoring at home, or monitoring by a family member significantly reduced blood pressure compared with usual monitoring in healthcare settings (see results table). Adjusting for publication bias reduced this difference (mean difference in systolic pressure: 2.2 mmHg, 95%CI -0.9 to 5.3; mean difference in diastolic pressure: 1.9 mmHg, 95%CI 0.6 to 3.2). At 1 year, the relative risk of having blood pressure above the target was lower in people who were monitoring themselves at home compared with people monitored in the healthcare system (RR 0.9, 95%CI 0.8 to 1.0).

Review methods: Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two reviewers. Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Nine articles (from eight original randomised controlled trials) met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. In total, 578 participants were enrolled across the trials, with participants presenting with prehypertension/hypertension (n. = 3 trials), type 1 or 2 diabetes (n. = 2), heart disease (n. = 2) and stroke (n. = 1). Meta-analyses, using standardised mean differences, showed evidence of reductions in stress (- 0.36; 95% CI - 0.67 to - 0.09; p. = 0.01), depression (- 0.35; 95% CI - 0.53 to - 0.16; p. = 0.003) and anxiety (- 0.50; 95% CI - 0.70 to - 0.29; p. < 0.001).

In view of this finding, we conducted a systematic review to examine, if this effect of allopurinol on BP can be extended to other patient populations. Methods: MEDLINE was searched for randomized control trials (RCT) comparing the effects of allopurinol vs placebo (1966- November 2010). Our primary endpoints were changes in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used for data analysis. The Cohen's (Graph presented) destimate was used to compare the means, while publication bias was checked by the egger's publication bias test. Results: We identified six RCT's, including the study by Feig et al, with follow up duration between 1 and 24 months. The studies were divided into two subgroups based on presence of underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). During analysis, the SBP (Figure 1) and DBP reduction shown by Feig et al was greater than the rest of the studies. Hence, we separately examined the data from the remaining five studies, comprising of three studies with 204 CKD patients and two studies with 97 patients without CKD. In these five studies, overall a small decrease in SBP was noted, while there was no change in the DBP (Table I). The small drop in SBP was consistent across both the subgroups, while there is some decrease in DBP in patients with underlying CKD compared to those without CKD. Conclusion: The reduction in BP reported by Feig et al in a cohort of adolescent patients was not reproduced in real world patients with long standing hypertension and other comorbidities. Based on our analysis, allopurinol is not an effective agent to lower BP (Figure 1). (Table presented).","address":"V.

The present meta-analysis attempts to evaluate safety and efficacy of dual CCB therapy. Methods: A Pubmed and Cochrane search for randomized clinical trials published from 1966-2009 was performed using the terms dihydropyridines, non-dihydropyridines and individual DHP and NDH CCBs. We abstracted data on demographics, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), heart rate (HR) and adverse effects with DHP or NDH monotherapy and DHP/ NDH dual therapy. Results: A total of 37 abstracts were retrieved, 16 studies further analyzed and 11, 9, 10 and 9 were finally included for the SBP, DBP, HR and safety analysis respectively. The total number of patients was 900 with 298 on dual CCB therapy. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 18 weeks. Dual CCB therapy compared to DHP monotherapy incrementally lowered SBP by 6.4 mmHg (p < 0.001) and DBP by 4.9 mmHg (p < 0.02). Compared to NDH monotherapy, dual CCB therapy lowered SBP by 10.5mmHg (p< 0.001) and DBP by 3.6 mmHg (p = 0.035)(figure 1). Patients on dual CCB therapy had a significantly higher HR compared to NDH monotherapy and significantly lower HR compared to DHP monotherapy (p < 0.01). The addition of a NDH to a DHP reduced the incidence of flushing (p < 0.01), dizziness (P < 0.01) and headache (p < 0.005) but not the incidence of pedal edema. No significant heart block was observed with dual CCB therapy. Conclusions: Dual CCB therapy lowers blood pressure significantly better than CCB monotherapy with less adverse events. However, given the lack of data on outcome and long-term safety, dual CCB therapy should be used sparingly. [Figure1]. Table presented.","address":"C.L.

Aliskiren's inhibitory effect on angiotensin I generation, through renin blockade, is highly specific and long-lasting (24 hours). This feature differentiates aliskiren from traditional antihypertensive drugs. Areas covered: This paper reviews the results of various clinical trials which investigate the safety and efficacy of aliskiren on blood pressure (BP) reduction and clinical end points. Expert opinion: Aliskiren is suitable for once-daily administration. Its antihypertensive effect is comparable or superior to that of other antihypertensive agents at recommended doses. The tolerability profile of aliskiren is placebo-like at the licensed doses of 150 and 300 mg. In particular, the discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurs similarly among patients treated with either aliskiren or placebo. Aliskiren is not recommended in association with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment. Pending disclosure of full results, the early termination of the ALTITUDE seems to confirm previous concerns about the safety of the dual pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in these patients. Aliskiren is a well-tolerated antihypertensive drug that may help to achieve the recommended targets of BP control. (copyright) 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.","address":"F.

This systematic review, based on lifestyle interventions for adults (18 to 65 years) with mean baseline BMI of <35 kg/m2, links weight change to blood pressure difference. A systematic review of studies reporting weight differences and blood pressure outcomes, published between 1990 and 2008 with follow-up of (greater-than or equal to)2 years identified 8 clinical trials or controlled before and after studies (represented by 9 articles) and 8 cohort studies. Differences ranged from -11 to +4kg for weight, -7 to +2.2 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure and -13 to +6.1 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure. For this population group, no quantifiable relationship between weight and diastolic blood pressure difference was found, possibly because of small weight losses, differing weight status responses, or because pharmacologically controlled hypertension masked weight loss influences. Systolic differences were in line with previous reviews of 1 kg:1 mm Hg relationship, but only for follow-up periods of 2 to 3 years, possibly reflecting the fact that regardless of maintained weight loss, blood pressure often reverts back to higher levels. Lifestyle interventions for weight and blood pressure are limited in this target group, and there has been no exploration of successful intervention components. An individual patient data analysis may uncover baseline and medication effects, explore differences between weight groups, and may identify successful components. Such an analysis would enable effective development of preventative interventions for both hypertension and obesity. (copyright) 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.","address":"L.

Strategies that improve hypertension control are therefore urgently needed. This study aimed to assess the relative efficacies of various antihypertensive drugs commonly used in France in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) by using a meta-analytical approach. This update of a previously published meta-analytical approach extends the number of drugs evaluated from 13 to 19. Methods: A total of 80 randomised, controlled trials published between 1973 and 2007 involving 10 818 patients were selected for inclusion in the meta-analytical approach. Data were examined for 19 drugs, and 16 drugs were included in the analysis: hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide sustained-release (SR), atenolol, amlodipine, lercanidipine, manidipine, enalapril, ramipril, trandolapril, candesartan cilexetil, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan medoxomil, telmisartan, valsartan and aliskiren. Weighted average reductions in SBP and DBP over a period of 8-12 weeks were calculated for each drug from information on both the mean and the variability in BP reduction. No trials evaluating furosemide, spironolactone or cicletanine satisfied the inclusion criteria for this analysis. Results: The average weighted reductions in SBP over 8-12 weeks were most marked with diuretics, and in particular indapamide SR 1.5 mg/day (mean change from baseline -22.2mm Hg), which reduced SBP to a greater extent than any of the other drugs evaluated (at any dosage considered). Average weighted reductions in DBP were generally similar with all classes of antihypertensives and ranged from -11.4mm Hg with the (beta)-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol and calcium channel antagonists to -10.3mm Hg with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists. Conclusion: This new analysis supports the results of the earlier investigation, in that indapamide SR 1.5 mg/day appeared to be the most effective drug for producing significant reductions in SBP within 8-12 weeks, which is an essential element in optimising cardiovascular prevention among hypertensive patients. The clinical application of these results should take into consideration all the limitations discussed in this analysis. (copyright) 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

In this metaanalysis, we wished to examine the influence of medicated status in hypertensives undergoing relaxation treatments. We used the criteria of randomized controlled trials comparing relaxation treatments with no active treatment or sham therapy for a minimum 8 weeks on adults with systolic bp(SBP) over 140mmHg or diastolic bp over 85mmHg, controlling for medicated status for hypertension. We included eligible trials found before and searched databases since, yielding 27 studies comprising 1381 subjects meeting criteria including mean changes with standard deviation. The metaanalysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta Analysis(version 2.2.064). Delta was defined as the difference in SBP between the control minus the treated group. The studies were grouped into 1)unmedicated versus 2) medicated or mixed groups. As there were only 3 studies where all subjects were medicated, we used mixed groups which is a limitation to this analysis. Using a mixed effects analysis we found for the 9 unmedicated studies the delta was -0.8mmHg(95%CL:-3.0 - +1.5, p=.494). The delta for the 18 medicated or mixed studies was -5.3mmHg(95%CL: -7.7- -2.9, p<.0005). The difference between these 2 groups was significant at p=.001. There was significant heterogeneity between unmedicated and medicated or mixed studies(p=0.007).This metaanalysis suggests that relaxation treatments alone are ineffective in substantially lowering bp in hypertensives and that the effect on medicated hypertensives may relate to other factors such as promoting adherence.","address":"B.

Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed through October 2011 using the keywords and medical subject headings azilsartan, azilsartan medoxomil, TAK-491, TAK-536, and Edarbi. Citations eligible for inclusion were in vitro or in vivo evaluations of azilsartan medoxomil with no restrictions on patient population or indication used. Data related to the patient populations and outcomes of interest were extracted from each citation. Results: Three trials are available in full publication form, with others available only as abstracts. Azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg and 80 mg daily significantly improves both systolic and diastolic BP from baseline compared with placebo, and the 80 mg dose has greater efficacy than other ARBs, including olmesartan 40 mg daily and valsartan 320 mg daily. Improvements in both 24-hour BP using ambulatory monitoring and clinic BPs, as well as a higher proportion of patients reaching goal, have been seen with azilsartan medoxomil. Additional information shows added BP lowering when azilsartan medoxomil is combined with chlorthalidone. Adverse events are similar with azilsartan medoxomil compared to other ARBs and include headache, dizziness, urinary tract infections, and fatigue. Conclusions: Azilsartan medoxomil is a safe and effective ARB with a unique pharmacologic profile compared with other agents, including slowed angiotensin-II type 1 (AT1) receptor dissociation rates and improved receptor specificity. Studies have shown azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg once daily to reduce BP to a greater extent than valsartan and olmesartan, with similar safety and tolerability.

We extracted data independently in duplicate and conducted meta-analysis by analysing trial participants in groups to which they were randomized, regardless of subsequent treatment actually received. RESULTS: Thirteen trials with 91 561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers to placebo (four trials; n = 23 613), diuretics (five trials; n = 18 241), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (four trials; n = 44 825), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (three trials; n = 10 828). Compared to placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (0.88, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (0.93, 0.81-1.07) or cardiovascular mortality (0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of CCBs (1.24, 1.11-1.40) and RAS inhibitors (1.30, 1.11-1.53), and that on total cardiovascular events less than that of CCBs (1.18, 1.08-1.29). In addition, patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment than those on diuretics (1.80; 1.33-2.42) or RAS inhibitors (1.41; 1.29-1.54). CONCLUSION: Beta-blockers are inferior to CCBs and to RAS inhibitors for reducing several important hard end points. Compared with diuretics, they had similar outcomes, but were less well tolerated.

Data was independently extracted from full texts using predefined data fields and study quality indicators. Results: 8 RCTs were eligible. All pooled analyses were based on random effects models. There was no difference in ability to carry out ADLs with antihypertensive treatment for 4 years (OR 0.91, [0.76, 1.09]). There was a reduction in between group systolic (mean difference (MD) -6.86 [-9.66, -4.05]) and diastolic (MD -3.14 [-4.00, -2.29]) BP. Significant heterogeneity was observed among studies which didn't significantly change with subgroup analysis for the primary outcome. Non-standardised reporting of QOL outcomes limited meta-analysis of QOL. Conclusions: There is no evidence that blood pressure lowering prevents functional impairment but a non-significant trend towards benefit was observed. Standardised reporting of functional outcomes will benefit future SRs in this area.","address":"M.

Methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 2-weeks duration comparing antihypertensive agents either as mono-therapy/ combination therapy with either placebo or another medication or comparing different doses of the same medication, in children 1-18 years with hypertension, were included. Standard methods developed by the Cochrane Collaboration were used. Results: Nineteen trials with 3277 children and follow up period ranging from 3 to 24 weeks were included. There were 4 RCTs comparing a drug directly with placebo, 11 dose finding trials, 2 trials comparing calcium channel blockers with angiotensin receptor blocker, 1 trial comparing central alpha blocker with a diuretic and 1 trial comparing an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker (Figure 1). None of the included studies evaluated effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on end organ damage. The trials were of variable risk of bias, and most were industry funded. Among the trials comparing drug directly to placebo: Candesartan (1 trial, n=240), reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.4 mmHg (95% CI -9.3, -3.5) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 5.3 mmHg (95% CI -9.3, -1.3); Metoprolol (1 trial, n=140), reduced SBP by 4.2 mmHg (95% CI -8.2 to -0.2) but not DBP (-3.2 mmHg 95% CI -7.1 to +0.7); Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorthiazide (1 trial, n=94), did not result in a significant reduction in SBP (-4.4 mmHg, 95% CI - 9.0 to +0.2) but did have an effect on DBP (-4.5 mmHg, 95% CI -8.3 to - 0.7) and Felodipine ER (1 trial, n=133) was not effective in reducing SBP (-0.6mmHg, 95% CI -2.8 to +1.7) or DBP (-1.86 mmHg, 95% CI - 5.2 to +1.5). Most commonly used antihypertensive agents were safe to use in these short-term studies. Conclusion: Overall, there are sparse data informing the use of antihypertensive agents in children, with outcomes reported limited to blood pressure and not end-organ damage, and over short to medium term follow up. Most data available concerns candesartan which effectively lowers blood pressure. All agents appear safe, at least in the short-term. (Figure presented).","address":"S.

Methods A meta-analysis was conducted in accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) requirements, to assess the effect of IPP and VPP on SBP in Europeans, and to explore some determinants of this effect. Results Ninety-one publications on the effect of IPP and VPP on SBP in Europeans were identified, and 14 trials with 15 sets of data (n = 1,306) met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.

Although not all individual trials showed a statistically significant effect of IPP or VPP in reducing SBP, the combination of all data for the two peptides yielded a statistically significantly greater effect for IPP/VPP than for placebo. The decrease in SBP with IPP/VPP was 1.28mm Hg (95% CI,-2.09 to-0.48, P = 0.0017) and the decrease in diastolic BP (DBP) was 0.59mm Hg (95% CI,-1.18 to-0.01, P = 0.047).

The aims were to quantify and compare BP changes for each training modality and identify patient subgroups exhibiting the largest BP changes. Methods and Results--Randomized controlled trials lasting (greater-than or equal to)4 weeks investigating the effects of exercise on BP in healthy adults (age (greater-than or equal to)18 years) and published in a peer-reviewed journal up to February 2012 were included. Random effects models were used for analyses, with data reported as weighted means and 95% confidence interval. We included 93 trials, involving 105 endurance, 29 dynamic resistance, 14 combined, and 5 isometric resistance groups, totaling 5223 participants (3401 exercise and 1822 control). Systolic BP (SBP) was reduced after endurance (-3.5 mm Hg [confidence limits-4.6 to-2.3]), dynamic resistance (-1.8 mm Hg [-3.7 to-0.011]), and isometric resistance (-10.9 mm Hg [-14.5 to-7.4]) but not after combined training. Reductions in diastolic BP (DBP) were observed after endurance (-2.5 mm Hg [-3.2 to-1.7]), dynamic resistance (-3.2 mm Hg [-4.5 to-2.0]), isometric resistance (-6.2 mm Hg [-10.3 to-2.0]), and combined (-2.2 mm Hg [-3.9 to-0.48]) training. BP reductions after endurance training were greater (P<0.0001) in 26 study groups of hypertensive subjects (-8.3 [-10.7 to-6.0]/-5.2 [-6.8 to-3.4] mm Hg) than in 50 groups of prehypertensive subjects (-2.1 [-3.3 to-0.83]/-1.7 [-2.7 to-0.68]) and 29 groups of subjects with normal BP levels (-0.75 [-2.2 to +0.69]/-1.1 [-2.2 to-0.068]). BP reductions after dynamic resistance training were largest for prehypertensive participants (-4.0 [-7.4 to-0.5]/-3.8 [-5.7 to-1.9] mm Hg) compared with patients with hypertension or normal BP. Conclusion--Endurance, dynamic resistance, and isometric resistance training lower SBP and DBP, whereas combined training lowers only DBP. Data from a small number of isometric resistance training studies suggest this form of training has the potential for the largest reductions in SBP. (copyright) 2013 The Authors.","address":"N.A.

Studies have shown that in order to achieve this goal it is necessary the combination of more than one antihypertensive drug class. Objective To evaluate the therapeutic effect in BP values and the side effects of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide (VAL/HCTZ) vs Valsartan and Amlodipine (VAL/AMLO) associations. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review using different databases. Only double-blinded randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Results The Research in the databases selected 17 to the meta-analysis. The number of patients was 7257 (4669 - VAL/HCTZ and 2588 - VAL/AMLO). The comparison between the two associations showed no statistical difference when lowering the systolic BP and diastolic BP. The association of VAL/HCTZ has more complains of dizziness when compared to VAL/AMLO (OR of 2.08-95% CI -1.54 to 2.80). On the other hand the combination with amlodipine generated more oedema (OR 16.19-95% CI 7.61-34.4). There was no difference between the therapies regarding headache (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78-1.30). When analyzing the variable nullany side effectsnull, VAL/AMLO had an OR of 2.63 (95% CI 2.32-2.98) when compared to VAL/HCTZ, showing that the combined therapy with AMLO has more side effects. The association of VAL/AMLO had a greater chance of discontinuity in comparison with VAL/HCTZ, since the OR for treatment discontinuity was 1.20 (95% CI 1.02-1.41). There was no statistical difference in the data regarding the lowering of blood pressure between VAL/HCTZ and AMLO/AMLO. The association with amlodipine had more side effects and dropout. The drug doses have particularities regarding the antihypertensive effects. CONCLUSION: Though the two associations have similar antihypertensive effects, VAL/HCTZ had a better therapeutic profile once it showed fewer side effects and less treatment dropout than VAL/AMLO association (Figure 1).","address":"L.

Our aim was to study the effect of liraglutide on SBP by quartile of baseline SBP. Methods: A meta-analysis across the six phase 3 liraglutide clinical trials (the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) programme) was carried out. Patients treated with liraglutide 1.2 mg (n=896), liraglutide 1.8 mg (n=1362) or placebo (n=520) were included in the analysis. Mean SBP changes from baseline were analysed using an ANCOVA model adjusted for trial, baseline SBP and baseline SBP quartile. The investigators were not given specific instructions on lowering blood pressure with medication during the trials. Results: Baseline SBP in all treatment groups was similar. Overall, significant reductions from baseline in SBP were seen with liraglutide 1.2 mg (2.5 mmHg, p=0.0030) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (2.6 mmHg, p=0.0008) but not with placebo (-0.2 mmHg, p=0.7828). To investigate the longitudinal effect on SBP from baseline to week 26 repeated measure analysis with a model adjusted for baseline SBP quartile was used. The effect of baseline SBP quartile was significant (p<0.0001). At first visit after 2 weeks of treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg or liraglutide 1.8 mg SBP was reduced by 3.0 mmHg and 2.6 mmHg, respectively, before any significant weight loss occurred. These reductions were maintained over 26 weeks. Thus, after 26 weeks of treatment SBP reductions of 2.7 mmHg and 2.6 mmHg with liraglutide 1.2 mg and liraglutide 1.8 mg, respectively, were observed. In patients receiving placebo SBP was reduced by 0.8 mmHg and 0.9 mmHg after 2 and 26 weeks, respectively. The greatest SBP reductions (-11.4 mmHg) were seen in the quartile with highest baseline SBP (Table). Conclusions: Patients with T2D often have elevated blood pressure, which exacerbates CV risk. Treatment with liraglutide reduces SBP within 2 weeks, preceding any significant weight change. This effect on SBP was sustained over time and was enhanced in patients with baseline hypertension. Liraglutide may, therefore, have a beneficial effect on CV risk, especially in patients with high SBP.

The six large phase 3 Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) studies have shown that, in T2D patients, the once-daily human GLP-1 analogue liraglutide reduces HbA1c by 1.0-1.5% with concomitant mean weight loss of approximately 3 kg and, importantly, that it reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 2.7-6.6 mmHg (min, max baseline SBP, mmHg: 128/76-134/81). We now have investigated the effect of liraglutide on SBP by quartile of baseline SBP. Materials and methods: A meta-analysis across the LEAD studies was performed. Patients treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg (n=1362), liraglutide 1.2 mg (n=896) or placebo (PBO n=520) were stratified by quartile of baseline SBP. An ANCOVA model adjusted for trial, baseline SBP and baseline SBP quartile was employed to analyse mean SBP changes from baseline. Baseline SBP quartile limits were 80 mmHg(less-than or equal to)SBP(less-than or equal to)120 mmHg in Q1; 120 mmHg <SBP(less-than or equal to)130 mmHg in Q2; 130 mmHg <SBP(less-than or equal to)140 mmHg in Q3 and 140 mmHg <SBP(less-than or equal to)190 mmHg in Q4. The investigators did not receive specific instructions on lowering blood pressure with medications during the trials, in which HbA1c reduction was the primary endpoint. Results: Overall, mean SBP decreased significantly from baseline with li-raglutide 1.8 mg and liraglutide 1.2 mg by 2.6 mmHg (p=0.0008) and 2.5 mmHg (p=0.0030), respectively, and was sustained for 26 weeks. No significant change was seen with PBO (-0.2 mmHg, p=0.7828). Repeated measure analysis with a model adjusted for baseline SBP quartile was used to investigate the longitudinal effect on SBP from baseline to week 26. Full impact on SBP was achieved at first visit after 2 weeks (Figure) before any major weight loss had occurred. The effect associated with baseline SBP quartile was significant (p<0.0001). The greatest reductions were observed in the quartile with highest baseline SBP. Thus, changes from baseline of -11.4 mmHg in Q4, -4.7 mmHg in Q3, -0.4 mmHg in Q2 and +4.8 mmHg in Q1 were observed with liraglutide 1.8 mg. Similarly, changes of -11.4 mmHg in Q4, -6.2 mmHg in Q3, +0.4 mmHg in Q2 and +5.4 mmHg in Q1 were observed with liraglu-tide 1.2 mg. Conclusion: Overall, liraglutide treatment reduces and sustains SBP over 26 weeks, especially in patients with elevated SBP at baseline. The impact on SBP is achieved within 2 weeks and cannot be explained by weight loss alone. Thus, liraglutide treatment may improve the cardiovascular risk profile of T2D patients, with patients with elevated SBP possibly experiencing a greater benefit (Graph presented).","address":"V.

The outcome measure was change in blood pressure. Results The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 36 trials.

The majority of trials were small with no posttreatment follow-up or follow-up of less than 6 months. Qualitative heterogeneity of the included studies (e.g. poor quality of the trials, differences in interventions and inconsistencies in the measurement of outcomes) meant that it was inappropriate to pool data in the form of a meta-analysis. A narrative summary of the data based on trial authors' conclusions is presented. No studies reported long-term (>12 months) follow-up of patients. Data were grouped first by treatment type and then by comparator.

International dietary guidelines for the prevention of hypertension, however, have not addressed fructose intake directly. Purpose: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of fructose in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrate on systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Hypothesis: We hypothesized fructose intake in isocaloric and hypercaloric exchange for other carbohydrate sources would not have a significant effect on SBP, DBP, and MAP. Methods: Studies were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (through September 29 2011). Human clinical trials that investigated isocaloric oral fructose exchange for other carbohydrate sources for at least 7 days were included in the analysis. A generic inverse variance method using random effects weighting was used to pool data. Pooled data were expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified by I2. Study quality was assessed using the Heyland Methodological Quality Score (MQS). Results: Thirteen isocaloric (n= 325 participants) and two hypercaloric (n= 24) trials met the eligibility criteria. Overall, fructose intake in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrate decreased DBP (MD=-1.40 [95% CI: -2.69, -0.10]) and MAP (MD= -1.16 [95% CI: -2.11, -0.20]). There was no significant effect of fructose on SBP (MD= -1.05 [95% CI: -2.46, 0.36]). However, subgroup analyses revealed potentially important heterogeneous findings. In a priori subgroups, fructose format (fluid) was a significant modifier of the SBP effect. The effects of both DBP and MAP were modified by aspects of study design (non-randomization, parallel design) and study quality (MQS <8). Furthermore, the DBP effect was modified under conditions of follow-up >4weeks and MAP by carbohydrate comparator (high fructose corn syrup). The two hypercaloric fructose feeding trials found no significant MAP effect of fructose in comparison to other carbohydrate. Limitations: A small number of isocaloric trials and two hypercaloric trials were included, limiting the strength of the conclusion. Conclusion: Contrary to previous concerns, we found isocaloric substitution of fructose for other carbohydrate did not adversely affect SBP, DBP, or MAP in humans. Further larger and longer trials are needed to confirm results.","address":"V.

The purpose of this study was to use the meta-analysis approach to evaluate the efficacy of triple combination of ARB and Aml and HCTZ. Medical literature was reviewed systematically by searching PubMED, EMBASE, Cochrane and BIOSIS databases by terms (azilsartan or candesartan or eprosartan or irbesartan or losartan or olmesartan or telmisartan or valsartan) and amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Randomized, controlled trials with parallel groups which investigated triple or dual combinations of relevant molecules were included. Fixed or random effects models were applied to pooling of data to evaluate the sensitivity of results. The fixed-effects estimates were mainly reported since most of the pooled results obtained showed low heterogeneity. Of the 107 studies, only one with valsartan and one with olmesartan met the inclusion criteria. The difference in sistolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) between pre and post treatment of Aml/ARB, Aml/HCTZ, ARB/HCTZ and ARB/Aml/HCTZ were recorded for both studies. The duration of triple combination treatment was 8 weeks in both studies. From 2 studies, the data of 4694 patients were evaluated. The weighted mean changes of SBP/DBP were calculated as -31.7/-19.7, -29.4/-17.2, -30.8/-18.2 and -38.4/-23.2 mmHg for Aml/ARB, Aml/HCTZ, ARB/HCTZ and ARB/Aml/HCTZ treatments, respectively.

Safety and efficacy studies in terms of evidence-based medical practice have become more prevalent in application to Chinese Herbal Medicine. It is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of berberine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of available clinical data.\rMaterials and methods We searched the English databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane library, EMbase, etc., and Chinese databases including China biomedical literature database (CBM), Chinese Technology Journal Full-text Database, Chinese journal full text database (CNKI), and Wanfang digital periodical full text database. Relevant studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan5.0 software after data extraction and the quality of studies assessment.\rResults Twenty-seven randomized controlled clinical trials were included with 2569 patients. There are seven subgroups in our meta-analysis: berberine versus placebo or berberine with intensive lifestyle intervention versus intensive lifestyle intervention alone; berberine combined with oral hypoglycemic versus hypoglycemic alone; berberine versus oral hypoglycemic; berberine combined with oral lipid lowering drugs versus lipid lowering drugs alone; berberine versus oral lipid lowering drugs; berberine combined with oral hypotensor versus hypotensive medications; berberine versus oral hypotensive medications. In the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we found that berberine with lifestyle intervention tended to lower the level of FPG, PPG and HbA1c than lifestyle intervention alone or placebo; the same as berberine combined with oral hypoglycaemics to the same hypoglycaemics; but there was no statistical significance between berberine and oral hypoglycaemics. As for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, berberine with lifestyle intervention was better than lifestyle intervention, berberine with oral lipid lowering drugs was better than lipid lowering drugs alone in reducing the level of TC and LDL-C, and raising the level of HDL-C. In the comparative study between berberine and oral lipid lowering drugs, there was no statistical significance in reducing the level of TC and LDL-C, but berberine shows better effect in lowering the level of TG and raising the level of HDL-C. In the treatment of hypertension, berberine with lifestyle intervention tended to lower the level of blood pressure more than the lifestyle intervention alone or placebo did; The same occurred when berberine combined with oral hypotensor was compared to the same hypotensor. Notably, no serious adverse reaction was reported in the 27 experiments. Conclusion This study indicates that berberine has comparable therapeutic effect on type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia and hypertension with no serious side effect.\rConsidering the relatively low cost compared with other first-line medicine and treatment, berberine might be a good alternative for low socioeconomic status patients to treat type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension over long time period. Due to overall limited quality of the included studies, the therapeutic benefit of berberine can be substantiated to a limited degree. Better methodological quality, large controlled trials using standardized preparation are expected to further quantify the therapeutic effect of berberine.","address":"F.

Few studies have quantitatively assessed pharmacists' interventions in hypertensive patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify and quantify outcomes sensitive to pharmacists' interventions. METHODS: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE were searched from inception through December 2006. Two independent reviewers identified articles: results were compared and resolved through consensus. Data extracted included intervention type, patient numbers, demographics, study characteristics, instruments used, data compared, and outcomes reported. A random effects meta-analysis was used to combine data. Study quality was assessed using the Downs-Black scale. RESULTS: Of 203 potential articles identified. 98 were selected and their abstracts were read. Nine of these were reviewed full-text and 19 more were identified from references, resulting in a total of 28 articles. Research designs included 18 randomized controlled trials. 6 single-arm clinical trials, 3 nonrandomized comparative trials, and 1 database study. Average quality score was 66% (plus or minus) 12% (fair). Medication management (82%) and hypertension education (68%) were the interventions most used. Thirty-nine study results (57% of all outcomes evaluated) were sensitive to pharmacists' interventions. Meta-analysis of 2246 patients in 13 studies found that pharmacists' interventions significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (10.7 (plus or minus) 11.6 mm Hg; p = 0.002). while controls remained unchanged (3.2 (plus or minus) 12.1 mm Hg; p = 0.361). Pharmacists' interventions further reduced systolic blood pressure (6.9 (plus or minus) 12.1 mm Hg; p = 0.047) over controls. Nonsensitive results included further reduction in diastolic blood pressure (3.6 (plus or minus) 3.7 mm Hg: p = 0.06), quality of life (1 of 8 significant), and adherence (5 of 13 significant). CONCLUSIONS: Systolic blood pressure is sensitive to pharmacists' interventions. Other outcomes may also be sensitive: however, more high-quality studies are needed for a comprehensive quantitative assessment.","address":"T.R.

Data on the incremental antihypertensiv efficacy with uptitration are scarce. It is also unclear if antihypertensive efficacy of losartan is comparable with other ARBs. Methods and results: We systematically reviewed PubMed/EMBASE/Cochrane databases for all randomized clinical trials until December2012 reporting 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) for most commonly available ARBs in patients with hypertension. Reduction in ABP with ARBs was evaluated at 25% of the maximum (max) dose, 50% of the max dose, and at the max dose. Comparisonwas made between 24 h BP-Lowering effect of losartan 50 and 100 mg and other ARBs at 50% max dose and the max dose, respectively. Sixty-two studies enrolling 15 289 patients (mean age 56 years; 60% men) with a mean duration of 10weeks were included in the analysis. Overall, the dose-response curve with ARBs was shallow with decrease of 10.3/6.7 (systolic/diastolic), 11.7/7.6, and 13.0/8.3 mmHgwith 25% max dose, 50% max dose, and with the max dose of ARBs, respectively.

Major outcomes were death, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, hospital stays, terminal renal failure, quality of life, and adverse events.

However, many recent studies have compared the efficacy of combination therapy of each agent with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of the combination CTD/ARB versus HCTZ/ARB. Methods: A search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases was performed as well as manual searches of bibliographies of key relevant articles. All clinical trials in which the blood pressure lowering effects of CTD/ARB were compared directly to that of HCTZ/ARB were selected. We calculated the weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) using the DerSimonian and Laird method. Results: Our search strategy yielded 40 studies, of which only 4 were randomized, head-to-head trials and therefore used for purposes of this analysis. The studies comprised a total of 1,839 patients with stage 1 - 2 essential hypertension either previously treated with other antihypertensive agents or treatment-na ve. All patients (mean age 56 years; mean systolic blood pressure 163.5 mmHg; 14.3% diabetics) on previous hypertensive medication regimens went through an appropriate wash-out period prior to initiating any of the studies. The overall SMD was -0.45 (95% CI, -0.56 to -0.35) in favor of CTD combined with ARBs over HCTZ combined with ARBs. CTD/ARB was found to have significantly greater antihypertensive effects as compared to the HCTZ/ARB treatment arms (p =0.049). Conclusion: Chlorthalidone is often compared to HCTZ and has equal, if not superior antihypertensive effects. When combined with angiotensin receptor blockers, CTD (in comparable doses) continues to demonstrate greater antihypertensive efficacy over HCTZ/ARB combinations, thus making it a strong treatment option for patients with essential hypertension.","address":"M.N.

METHODS: Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified as part of a systematic search in six electronic databases ending September 2012. RCTs comparing stress-reduction techniques versus no such techniques with a follow-up of at least 24 weeks and published in English or German were included. Outcomes of interest were death, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events, changes in blood pressure, and changes in antihypertensive medication. When appropriate, meta-analyses were used to combine data. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs analyzing different stress-reduction techniques such as biofeedback, relaxation or combined interventions were identified. Data were not reported for most of the patient-relevant outcomes, and meta-analyses could only be used to evaluate effects on blood pressure. The data indicated a blood pressure-lowering effect, but the studies had methodological shortcomings and heterogeneity between them was high. Mean group differences for DBP ranged from -10 to 1 mmHg and for SBP from -12 to 10 mmHg. In terms of antihypertensive medication, no favorable effects of stress-reduction techniques could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: The available RCTs on stress-reduction techniques used for at least 24 weeks appeared to indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect in patients with essential hypertension, but this should be interpreted with caution because of major methodological limitations. A benefit of specific stress-reduction techniques in hypertensive patients remains unproven.","address":"E.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for or against the effectiveness of green tea (Camellia sinensis) on blood pressure and lipid parameters. Methods and results: Electronic searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant human randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Hand searches of bibliographies were also conducted. The reporting quality of included studies was assessed using a checklist adapted from the CONSORT Statement. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility, assessed the reporting quality of the included studies, and extracted the data. As many as 474 citations were identified and 20 RCTs comprising 1536 participants were included. There were variations in the designs of the RCTs. A meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure favouring green tea (MD: -1.94 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.95 to -0.93; I2 = 8%; p = 0.0002). Similar results were also observed for total cholesterol (MD: -0.13 mmol/l; 95% CI: -0.2 to -0.07; I2 = 8%; p < 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (MD: -0.19 mmol/l; 95% CI: -0.3 to -0.09; I2 = 70%; p = 0.0004). Adverse events included rash, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal discomfort. Conclusion: Green tea intake results in significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. The effect size on systolic blood pressure is small, but the effects on total and LDL cholesterol appear moderate. Longer-term independent clinical trials evaluating the effects of green tea are warranted. (copyright) 2014 Elsevier B.V.","address":"I.

Weighted mean differences (WMD) and odds ratios with 95% confidence interval were calculated for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively.\rBackground The role of eplerenone in arterial hypertension has been investigated only in small studies. To systematically assess the efficacy and tolerability of eplerenone in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension, we did a meta-analysis of controlled randomized trials.\rResults A total of 11 trials and 3566 patients were overall included. Compared to placebo, eplerenone significantly reduced either SBP [WMD - 8.07, 95% CI - 8.17 to - 7.96 mm Hg, p < 0.00001] and DBP [WMD - 4.08, - 4.15 to - 4.01 mm Hg, p < 0.00001]. In the overall comparison, reduction of both SBP and DBP with eplerenone was greater than other antihypertensive agents (WMD for SBP - 1.50 mm Hg, p < 0.0001; WMD for DBP - 0.54 mm Hg, p < 0.00001); this was essentially driven by a greater anti-hypertensive action vs enalapril and losartan for SBP and vs losartan for DBP. Rates of any adverse event were significantly higher with eplerenone than placebo (odds ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.71; p = 0.005), whereas the occurrence of serious adverse events and hyperkalemia was similar.

The main findings indicated that the 2 classes of antihypertensive medications caused similar reductions in blood pressure, although higher rates of adverse events, especially cough, were reported by patients treated with ACEIs. In addition, the 2007 review indicated no treatmentrelated differences in lipid levels, glycemic control, or progression of kidney disease among the agents. Since 2007, 39 relevant studies have been published that compare outcomes for adults treated with ACEIs versus ARBs or a drug in one of these 2 classes versus a direct renin inhibitor (DRI). To systematically analyze findings from the new research, AHRQ commissioned and, in June 2011, published an updated comparative effectiveness review on the benefits and risks of agents that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), specifically ACEIs, ARBs, and DRIs. Objectives: To (a) familiarize health care professionals with the methods and findings from AHRQ's 2011 comparative effectiveness review on ACEIs, ARBs, and DRIs for adults with essential hypertension; (b) provide commentary and encourage consideration of the clinical and managed care applications of the review findings; and (copyright) identify limitations to the existing research on the benefits and risks of ACEIs, ARBs, and DRIs. Summary: Consistent with the findings from AHRQ's 2007 report, the 2011 update indicated no overall differences in blood pressure control, mortality rates, and major cardiovascular events in patients treated with ACEIs versus ARBs. With a low strength of evidence, 2 studies reported a small significantly greater blood pressure reduction for patients treated with the DRI aliskiren versus the ACEI ramipril. Studies evaluating the DRI aliskiren versus ACEIs and ARBs on mortality and morbidity outcomes were relatively short, and few deaths or cardiovascular events occurred, resulting in insufficient evidence to discern differences. A random-effects meta-analysis of 23 RCTs comparing ACEIs and ARBs found no significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved successful blood pressure control on a single antihypertensive agent.

Nine trials used chocolate containing 50% to 70% cocoa compared with white chocolate or other cocoa-free controls, while six trials compared high- with low-flavanol cocoa products. Daily flavanol dosages ranged from 30 mg to 1000 mg in the active treatment groups, and interventions ran for 2 to 18 weeks. Meta-regression analysis found study design and type of control to be borderline significant but possibly indirect predictors for blood pressure outcome.Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that dark chocolate is superior to placebo in reducing systolic hypertension or diastolic prehypertension. Flavanol-rich chocolate did not significantly reduce mean blood pressure below 140 mmHg systolic or 80 mmHg diastolic. (copyright) 2010 Ried et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","address":"K.

We found that while some studies reported a significant lowering of blood pressure with Mg supplementation, others did not. We present here our first meta-analysis of a uniform subset from this series of studies. Seven studies, involving 135 hypertensive subjects on anti-hypertensive medication continuously for at least six months, with no more than a two-week washout and with a mean starting systolic blood pressure (SBP) >155 mmHg, demonstrated a mean change of -18.7 mmHg [95% CI = -14.95 to -22.45] p<0.0001 and an effect size test (Cohen's d) = 1.19, i.e. a large and highly significant effect. Meta-analysis of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for these same seven studies showed a mean change in DBP of -10.9 mmHg [95% CI = -8.73 to -13.1], p<0.0001, with an effect size test (Cohen's d) = 1.19. Other studies from our original collection, approaching, but not meeting the >155mmHgstarting SBP values or not complying as regards anti-hypertensive medication usage, showed mean changes in both SBP and DBP with oral Mg that, while not approaching the high-responder values of the present study, appeared to include some high-responder subjects combined with low- or nonresponder subjects. This uniform subset of seven studies showed a strong effect of Mg treatment in hypertension, which is in stark contrast to results of three other meta-analyses. Using non-uniform sets of studies, the small effects reported in previous metaanalyses may reflect a blending of dissimilar studies, which acted to seriously underestimate the potential of Mg in hypertension in some (but not all) subjects. Within studies, blending of non-, moderate and highresponder subjects in any one study might mask strong effects of Mg treatment in some subjects.","address":"A.

The results of this systematic review indicate that reserpine has a statistically significant hypotensive effect on systolic blood pressure as first-line agent (weighted mean difference -7.92, 95%CI -14.05, -1.78).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) was conducted to determine the effects of the DASH diet on cardiovascular risk factors.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) DASH diet; (2) RCT; (3) risk factors including systolic and diastolic BP and glucose, HDL, LDL, TAG and total cholesterol concentrations; (4) control group. Random-effects models were used to determine the pooled effect sizes. Meta-regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between effect sizes, baseline values of the risk factors, BMI, age, quality of trials, salt intake and study duration. A total of twenty articles reporting data for 1917 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The duration of interventions ranged from 2 to 24 weeks. The DASH diet was found to result in significant decreases in systolic BP ( null 5(middle dot)2 mmHg, 95 % CI null 7(middle dot)0, null 3(middle dot)4; P< 0(middle dot)001) and diastolic BP ( null 2(middle dot)6 mmHg, 95 % CI null 3(middle dot)5, null 1(middle dot)7; P< 0(middle dot)001) and in the concentrations of total cholesterol ( null 0(middle dot)20 mmol/l, 95 % CI null 0(middle dot)31, null 0(middle dot)10; P< 0(middle dot)001) and LDL ( null 0(middle dot)10 mmol/l, 95 % CI null 0(middle dot)20, null 0(middle dot)01; P= 0(middle dot)03).

These changes predicted a reduction of approximately 13 % in the 10-year Framingham risk score for CVD. The DASH diet improved cardiovascular risk factors and appeared to have greater beneficial effects in subjects with an increased cardiometabolic risk. The DASH diet is an effective nutritional strategy to prevent CVD.","address":"M.

But the majority of patients (70-80%) require treatment with more than one agent. Thiazide diuretic is recommended for two-drug therapy as it enhances a hypotensive effect of the second component. Combined use of ACE-I and thiazide diuretic results in complementary mode of action and favorable tolerability profile. Usage of combined preparations containing small doses of two adequately matched antihypertensives can be beneficial for patients compliance because of better and earlier achieved control of blood pressure with smaller number of adverse effects at the same time, than in case of monotherapy. Aim of the analysis: Assessment of clinical effectiveness (hypotensive effect and tolerability) of combination therapy with ramipril plus hydrochlorothiazide compared with monotherapy of ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide or with combination therapy with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in blood hypertension treatment. Material and methods: Clinical assessment was performed according to PolAHTA Guidelines; analysis and credibility evaluation were based on the rules of evidence-based medicine (EBM). In order to find relevant clinical publications a systematic review of medical databases was performed. Results Systematic review revealed 4 \"head-to-head comparison\" clinical trials which made it possible to compare clinical efficacy and safety of analysed interventions. Meta-analysis of two trials revealed a statistically significant differences in blood pressure lowering effect in patients treated with combination of ramipril plus hydrochlorotiazide compared to monotherapy with ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide and combination therapy with captopril and hydrochlothiazide. Conclusions: Ramipril plus hydrochlorothiazide has stronger hypotensive effect than monotherapy with each of those drugs. Moreover, such combination therapy significantly decreased the risk of lack of response to antihypertensive treatment compared to monotherapy with ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide alone. It was also shown that combination of ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide is far more effective in maintenance of achieved target blood pressure than captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Lastly, depending on the type of adverse event the risk of such was lower or similar in two-drug treatment regiment based on ramipril compared with monotherapy with its components or combination therapy based on captopril.

From a health systems perspective, nullteam-based carenull (TBC) models have been proposed to improve care delivery. TBC is established to organize care around the patient's needs by adding new staff or changing the roles of existing staff to work with a primary care provider (PCP). Each team includes the patient, the patient's PCP, and other professionals such as nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and community health workers. TBC is frequently implemented with support for clinical decision-making; collaboration; and patient self-management. Systematic review methods developed for the Community Guide were used to evaluate the quality of available evidence on the effectiveness of TBC. This review was conceptualized and conducted by a team of subject matter experts working under the guidance of the Community Preventive Services Task Force, a non-federal, independent, unpaid panel of public health experts. An earlier review on TBC for BP control (Walsh et al. 2006) with 28 studies was initially identified. This was updated with a systematic search of the subsequent literature, which identified an additional 49 studies. Results from both bodies of evidence show robust evidence of effectiveness for TBC in improving BP outcomes. From the 49 studies identified in the updated search (2003-2012), the median improvement in the proportion of patients with their BP controlled was 12.0 percentage points (Interquartile interval (IQI): 3 to 19.5 pct. pts. from 31 studies) and the median reduction in systolic BP was 5.1 mmHg (IQI: 1.95-7.3 mmHg from 43 studies), compared to usual care. Outcomes for diabetes and high cholesterol also improved. Most studies used either a pharmacist or nurse to work with PCPs and patients. Medication management roles, where team members could make changes to medications independently or with PCP approval led to better outcomes compared to when only adherence support was provided to patients. Based on Community Guide rules of evidence, there is strong evidence that TBC models are effective in improving BP outcomes, especially when pharmacists and nurses are part of the team. Implementation can be a key component of the Medical Home Model for multiple CVD risk factors.","address":"B.

The weighted average reduction from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure for benazepril mono- therapy was 24.4 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.7 to 27.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and 15.7 mmHg (95% CI: 14.2 to 17.1mm Hg, P < 0.001). Benazepril tended to be inferior to CCBs in lowering systolic blood pressure by 3.4 mmHg (P = 0.08) but not in lowering diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.55), and similar as angiotensin-receptor blockers in lowering systolic blood pressure (P = 0.575) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.43). Angioe- dema was rare (0.2%); however, cough was rather common in patients on benazepril with a prevalence of 10%. Conclusions Benazepril is efficacious and safe in the management of hypertension in Chinese.","address":"J.-G.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) decrease variability in systolic blood pressure (SBPV) and stroke risk more than other classes, possibly due to decreased vascular tone. If so, there might be a correlation between drug-class effects on variability in SBP and on headache. We determined antihypertensive class effects on SBPV and headache during follow-up in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. We determined pooled estimates of treatment effect on group variability in BP (variance ratio, VR) and on the odds ratio for headache (OR) by random-effects meta-analysis. Antihypertensive drugs reduced the incidence of headache compared to placebo (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.82, p<0.0001, 198 comparisons, 43,672 patients), but there was significant heterogeneity between drug classes (p = 0.0007) with a greater effect of beta-blockers compared to placebo (VR = 0.49, 0.33-0.68, p<0.0001, 16 trials) or all other drug classes (OR = 0.73, 0.62-0.85, p = 0.0002, 49 trials) and a lack of effectiveness of CCBs (vs. placebo-OR = 0.95, 0.79-1.15, 65 trials; vs. other drugs-OR = 1.19, 1.05-1.35, p = 0.009, 101 trials).

Antihypertensive drugs reduce headache but the effect differs between classes, corresponding to their effects on SBPV and the risk of stroke. This may partly be explained by consistent antihypertensive class effects on vascular tone in the peripheral (variability) and cerebrovascular circulations (headache).

SEARCH METHODS: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and from hand searches in reference lists and systematic reviews (status as of 17th August, 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials in adult hypertensive patients with a study duration of at least 24 weeks comparing pharmacologic interventions (orlistat, sibutramine, rimonabant) for weight loss with placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Studies were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (p>0.1). Otherwise, we used the random effects method and investigated the cause of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: After the updated literature search, the number of studies remained the same, with eight studies comparing orlistat or sibutramine to placebo fulfilling our inclusion criteria. No relevant studies investigating rimonabant for weight loss were identified. No study included mortality and cardiovascular morbidity as a pre-defined outcome. Incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher in orlistat treated vs. placebo treated patients. Most frequent side effects with sibutramine were dry mouth, constipation and headache. Patients assigned to weight loss diets, orlistat or sibutramine reduced their body weight more effectively than patients in the usual care/placebo groups.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the dose-related reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ENaC blocker therapy as a first-line or second-line drug in patients with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012), EMBASE (1980 to August 2012) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in patients with primary hypertension that evaluate, for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks, the BP lowering efficacy of: 1) fixed-dose monotherapy with an ENaC blocker compared with placebo; or 2) an ENaC blocker in combination with another class of anti-hypertensive drugs compared with the respective monotherapy (without an ENaC blocker). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. WDAE information was also collected from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: No trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of ENaC blockers as monotherapy in patients with primary hypertension were identified. Only 6 trials evaluated the BP lowering efficacy of low doses of amiloride and triamterene as a second drug in 496 participants with a baseline BP of 151/102 mm Hg. The additional BP reduction caused by the ENaC blocker as a second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. The addition of low doses of amiloride and triamterene in these trials did not reduce BP. An estimate of the dose-related BP lowering efficacy for ENaC blockers was not possible because of a lack of trial data at higher doses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ENaC blockers do not have a statistically or clinically significant BP lowering effect at low doses but trials at higher doses are not available. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with ENaC blockers.","tags":["Epistemonikos","PubMed Health"]},{"recNumber":"410","type":"report","title":"The effects of statins on blood pressure in normotensive or hypertensive subjects--a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","journal":"International journal of cardiology","authors":["Banach, M.","Nikfar, S.","Rahimi, R.","Bielecka-Dabrowa, A.","Pencina, M.

A lack of persistence with treatment has however been shown to be linked to a worse cardiovascular prognosis. This review explores the blood pressure reduction and persistence with treatment of antihypertensive drugs and the cost consequences of poor persistence with pharmaceutical interventions in arterial hypertension. METHODS: We have searched the literature for data on blood pressure lowering effects of different antihypertensive drug classes and agents, on persistence with treatment, and on related costs. Persistence was measured as patients' medication possession rate. Results are presented in the form of a systematic review. RESULTS: Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs) have a competitive blood pressure lowering efficacy compared with ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers (BBs) and diuretics. 8 studies describing the persistence with treatment were identified. Patients were more persistent on ARBs than on ACEi and CCBs, BBs and diuretics. Thus the product of blood pressure lowering and persistence was higher on ARBs than on any other drug class. Although the price per tablet of more recently developed drugs (ACEi, ARBs) is higher than that of older ones (diuretics and BBs), the newer drugs result in a more favourable cost to effect ratio when direct drug costs and indirect costs are also considered. CONCLUSION: To evaluate drugs for the treatment of hypertension several key variables including the blood pressure lowering effect, side effects, compliance/persistence with treatment, as well as drug costs and direct and indirect costs of medical care have to be considered. ARBs, while nominally more expensive when drug costs are considered only, provide substantial cost savings and may prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality based on the more complete antihypertensive coverage. This makes ARBs an attractive choice for long term treatment of hypertension.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"134","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta‐blockers as second‐line therapy for primary hypertension","journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)","authors":["Chen, J.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects of beta-blocker therapy when given as a second-line drug in adult patients with primary hypertension. SEARCH STRATEGY: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-Aug 2009), EMBASE (1988-Aug 2009) and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing a beta-blocker in combination with a drug from another class of anti-hypertensive drugs compared with that drug alone for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality of each included study. MAIN RESULTS: 20 double-blind RCTs evaluated the BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as second-line drug in 3744 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 158/102 mmHg; mean duration of 7 weeks). The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was seen with adding a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers reduced heart rate by 10 beats/min at 1 to 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers did not statistically significantly increase withdrawals due to adverse effects but this was likely due to the lack of reporting of this outcome in 35% of the included RCTs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Addition of a beta-blocker to diuretics or calcium-channel blockers reduces BP by 6/4mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and by 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. When the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers from this review was compared to that of thiazide diuretics from our previous review (Chen 2009), second-line beta-blockers reduce systolic BP to the same extent as second-line thiazide diuretics, but reduce diastolic BP to a greater degree. The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure. This difference in the pattern of BP lowering with beta-blockers as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that beta-blockers appear to be less effective at reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes than thiazide diuretics, particularly in older individuals.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"202","type":"report","title":"Chiropractic spinal manipulation as a treatment of hypertension?

A recent meta-analysis by Graudal implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with BP reduction. However, Graudal's meta-analysis included a large number of very short-term trials with a large change in salt intake, and such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations for a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake. We have updated our Cochrane meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To assess (1) the effect of a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake (i.e. of public health relevance) on BP and whether there was a dose-response relationship; (2) the effect on BP by sex and ethnic group; (3) the effect on plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and reference list of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and duration of at least 4 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt vs usual salt) was -75 mmol/24-h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/d salt), the mean change in BP was -4.18 mmHg (95% CI: -5.18 to -3.18, I2=75%) for systolic and -2.06 mmHg (95% CI: -2.67 to -1.45, I2=68%) for diastolic BP. Meta-regression showed that age, ethnic group, BP status (hypertensive or normotensive) and the change in 24-h urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 5.8 mmHg (95%CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and the change in 24-h urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta-analysis by subgroup showed that, in hypertensives, the mean effect was -5.39 mmHg (95% CI: -6.62 to -4.15, I2=61%) for systolic and -2.82 mmHg (95% CI: -3.54 to -2.11, I2=52%) for diastolic BP. In normotensives, the mean effect was -2.42 mmHg (95% CI: -3.56 to -1.29, I2=66%) for systolic and -1.00 mmHg (95% CI: -1.85 to -0.15, I2=66%) for diastolic BP. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic BP was significant in both whites and blacks, men and women. Meta-analysis of hormone and lipid data showed that the mean effect was 0.26 ng/ml/hr (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.36, I2=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/l (95% CI: 44.92 to 101.48, I2=62%) for aldosterone, 31.67 pg/ml (95% CI: 6.57 to 56.77, I2=5%) for noradrenaline, 6.70 pg/ml (95% CI: -0.25 to 13.64, I2=12%) for adrenaline, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.11, I2=0%) for cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.12, I2=0%) for LDL, -0.02 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.01, I2=16%) for HDL, and 0.04 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.09, I2=0%) for triglycerides. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A modest reduction in salt intake for 4 or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group. With salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. There is no significant change in lipid levels. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates a significant association between the reduction in 24-h urinary sodium and the fall in systolic BP, indicating the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"138","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective beta‐blockers for primary hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Gavin, W.

Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta-blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the dose-related effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies. Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence). Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence). The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In people with mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonselective beta-blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of -10/-7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta-blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"136","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure lowering efficacy of diuretics as second‐line therapy for primary hypertension","journal":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","authors":["Jenny, M.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-three double-blind RCTs evaluating a thiazide in 15129 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 156/101 mmHg) were included. Hydrochlorothiazide was the thiazide used in 49/53 (92%) of the included studies. The additional BP reduction caused by the thiazide as a second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. Thiazides as a second-line drug reduced BP by 6/3 and 8/4 mmHg at doses of 1 and 2 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose respectively. The BP lowering effect was dose related. The effect was similar to that obtained when thiazides are used as a single agent. Only 3 double-blind RCTs evaluating loop diuretics were identified. These RCTs showed a BP lowering effect of a starting dose of about 6/3 mmHg. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Thiazides when given as a second-line drug have a dose related effect to lower blood pressure that is similar to when they are added as a first-line drug. This means that the BP lowering effect of thiazides is additive. Loop diuretics appear to have a similar blood pressure lowering effect as thiazides at 1 times the recommended starting dose. Because of the short duration of the trials and lack of reporting of adverse events, this review does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of adverse effects of diuretics given as a second-line drug.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"107","type":"report","title":"Atenolol vs nonatenolol β-blockers for the treatment of hypertension: a meta-analysis","journal":"The Canadian journal of cardiology","authors":["Kuyper, L.

METHODS: The Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were searched (January 2006-May 2013) for randomized trials evaluating stroke, myocardial infarction, death, or composite cardiovascular end points. Twenty-one hypertension trials with data on 145,811 participants were identified: 15 used atenolol, 7 were placebo-controlled trials, and 14 were active comparator trials. There were no trials of newer generation β-blockers identified. RESULTS: Among the elderly, atenolol was associated with an increased risk of stroke (relative risk [RR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.30) compared with other antihypertensive agents. The risk of stroke for nonatenolol β-blockers compared with other agents (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99-1.50) did not reach statistical significance in the elderly. In the young, atenolol was associated with reduced risk of stroke compared with other agents (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95), whereas nonatenolol β-blockers were associated with a lower risk of composite cardiac events (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.996) compared with placebo, with no significant difference in events compared with active controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the young, both atenolol and nonatenolol β-blockers are effective in reducing cardiovascular end points for hypertension without compelling indications.

This article considers the evidence supporting telmisartan/amlodipine combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension in patients with metabolic risk factors. METHODS: Clinical trials of telmisartan/amlodipine at doses of 40-80 mg/5-10 mg (T40-80/A5-10) in free, fixed-dose and single-pill combinations were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE and congress abstracts) up to and including June 2012, and from the Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) trial database. All identified trials were reviewed for data on hypertensive patients with obesity, diabetes, or both. Post-hoc subgroup analyses were carried out using the BI database to determine the relevant information if it was not previously reported. RESULTS: Thirteen clinical trials including 6886 patients were identified with data relevant for inclusion in this review. The telmisartan/amlodipine combination allowed a high proportion of hypertensive patients with metabolic conditions to achieve BP targets, particularly among patients who had previously failed to achieve BP targets with monotherapy. BP reductions and goal rate achievement were similarly high among patients with and without the presence of metabolic risk factors. BP reductions were maintained throughout the 24 h dosing period, and 24 h goal rates were obtained in a high proportion of patients. Particularly large reductions in BP with telmisartan/amlodipine were recorded among patients with severe hypertension (systolic BP ≥180 mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this post-hoc analysis further support the ability of the telmisartan/amlodipine combination to effectively reduce BP in hypertensive patients with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome, enabling the majority of patients to achieve target BP. This combination is also well tolerated, and may be considered a suitable option for these added-risk hypertensive patients.","tags":["Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"405","type":"report","title":"Effects of Massage on Blood Pressure in Patients With Hypertension and Prehypertension: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","journal":"The Journal of cardiovascular nursing","authors":["Liao, I.

One reviewer extracted and a second reviewer checked data from the included studies. RESULTS: We included 94 studies, 93 of which were in Chinese language, that evaluated the following interventions: health education, improved monitoring, family-support, self-management, healthcare management changes and training of providers. The study quality was generally poor, with high risk of biased outcome reporting and significant heterogeneity between studies.

BACKGROUND: HCTZ is the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug worldwide. More than 97% of all HCTZ prescriptions are for 12.5 to 25 mg per day. The antihypertensive efficacy of HCTZ by ambulatory BP monitoring is less well defined. METHODS: A systematic review was made using Medline, Cochrane, and Embase for all the randomized trials that assessed 24-h BP with HCTZ in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs. RESULTS: Fourteen studies of HCTZ dose 12.5 to 25 mg with 1,234 patients and 5 studies of HCTZ dose 50 mg with 229 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The decrease in 24-h BP with HCTZ dose 12.5 to 25 mg was systolic 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 5.3 to 7.7 mm Hg) and diastolic 4.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 6.0 mm Hg) and was inferior compared with the 24-h BP reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (mean BP reduction 12.9/7.7 mm Hg; p < 0.003), angiotensin-receptor blockers (mean BP reduction 13.3/7.8 mm Hg; p < 0.001), beta-blockers (mean BP reduction 11.2/8.5 mm Hg; p < 0.00001), and calcium antagonists (mean BP reduction 11.0/8.1 mm Hg; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in both systolic (p = 0.30) and diastolic (p = 0.15) 24-h BP reduction between HCTZ 12.5 mg (5.7/3.3 mm Hg) and HCTZ 25 mg (7.6/5.4 mm Hg). However, with HCTZ 50 mg, the reduction in 24-h BP was significantly higher (12.0/5.4 mm Hg) and was comparable to that of other agents. CONCLUSIONS: The antihypertensive efficacy of HCTZ in its daily dose of 12.5 to 25 mg as measured in head-to-head studies by ambulatory BP measurement is consistently inferior to that of all other drug classes.

Nicardipine is a very effective therapy for treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy and may be a better alternative to other available treatment options. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader will be able to evaluate the relative effectiveness of nicardipine for the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Compare the side effect profile of nicardipine to labetolol for the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy and calculate the appropriate dosing of nicardipine for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"214","type":"report","title":"Clinical effects of home telemonitoring in the context of diabetes, asthma, heart failure and hypertension: a systematic review","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","authors":["Paré, G.","Moqadem, K.","Pineau, G.","St-Hilaire, C."],"date":"2010/06/16 2010","urls":["http://www.epistemonikos.org/documents/1cc3738d50bbdac2477ea2204b7542305ba34a32"],"pages":"e21","volume":"12","number":"2","isbn":"1438-8871","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Home telemonitoring figures among the various solutions that could help attenuate some of the problems associated with aging populations, rates of chronic illness, and shortages of health professionals. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to further our understanding of the clinical effects associated with home telemonitoring programs in the context of chronic diseases. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review which covered studies published between January 1966 and December 2008. MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and the INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) database were consulted. Our inclusion criteria consisted of: (1) English language publications in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings and (2) studies involving patients with diabetes, asthma, heart failure, or hypertension, and presenting results on the clinical effects of home telemonitoring. RESULTS: In all, 62 empirical studies were analyzed. The results from studies involving patients with diabetes indicated a trend toward patients with home telemonitoring achieving better glycemic control. In most trials in which patients with asthma were enrolled, results showed significant improvements in patients' peak expiratory flows, significant reductions in the symptoms associated with this illness, and improvements in perceived quality of life. Virtually all studies involving patients with hypertension demonstrated the ability of home telemonitoring to reduce systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. Lastly, due to the equivocal nature of current findings of home telemonitoring involving patients with heart failure, larger trials are still needed to confirm the clinical effects of this technology for these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although home telemonitoring appears to be a promising approach to patient management, designers of future studies should consider ways to make this technology more effective as well as controlling possible mediating variables.","tags":["Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"915","type":"report","title":"A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis on the Effects of Garlic Preparations on Blood Pressure in Individuals With Hypertension","journal":"American journal of hypertension","authors":["Rohner, A.","Ried, K.","Sobenin, I.

Limited trial evidence suggests that garlic preparations reduce high blood pressure (BP). METHODS: We searched electronic databases through March 2014 to identify all randomized controlled trials that compared a garlic preparation to placebo in hypertensive patients. Trials were required to report BP values at baseline and after a follow-up of at least 4 weeks. RESULTS: Nine double-blind trials with 482 individuals fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Included trials were rather small, and the quality of the majority of included trials was moderate. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 26 weeks. All trials reported office BP measurements. Systolic BP and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were more effectively reduced in individuals treated with garlic preparations than in individuals treated with placebo. However, heterogeneity was high (weighted mean difference (WMD) for SBP was -9.1mm Hg; 95% confidence interval (CI), -12.7 to -5.4; P for heterogeneity = 0.0006; and I (2) = 71%; WMD for BP was -3.8mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.7 to -1.0; P for heterogeneity = 0.00001; I (2) = 80%). When analyses were restricted to higher-quality trials using intention-to-treat analysis or to trials with concealed treatment allocation and standardized and blinded BP measurement, effect sizes for SBP but not for DBP were lower and heterogeneity disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence from this review suggests that garlic preparations may lower BP in hypertensive individuals, the evidence is not strong. A well-conducted and powered trial of longer duration is needed to confirm these findings.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"994","type":"report","title":"Usefulness of phyto-oestrogens in reduction of blood pressure.

RESULTS: We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15 519 patients. The studies were conducted in 9 countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from 2 to 60 months. Because of heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in 7 of 9 studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8% to 19.6%. Motivational strategies were partly successful in 10 of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23%. Complex interventions comparing more than 1 technique increased adherence in 8 of 18 studies, ranging from 5% to a maximum of 41%. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication and should be tried as a first-line strategy, although there is so far less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed randomized controlled trials.","tags":["Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"609","type":"report","title":"Long‐term effects of weight‐reducing diets in hypertensive patients","journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)","authors":["Siebenhofer, Andrea","Jeitler, Klaus","Berghold, Andrea","Waltering, Andreas","Hemkens, Lars G.","Semlitsch, Thomas","Pachler, Christoph","Strametz, Reinhard","Horvath, Karl"],"date":"2011 2011","urls":["http://www.epistemonikos.org/documents/e8a0bbf46bd272f562cfe00eb8445fae328be7c5"],"pages":"CD008274","volume":"9","number":"9","isbn":"1469-493X","abstract":"BACKGROUND: All major guidelines for antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss. Thus dietary interventions that aim to reduce body weight might be a useful intervention to reduce blood pressure and adverse cardiovascular events associated with hypertension. OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives To assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in hypertensive patients on - all cause mortality - cardiovascular morbidity - adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events and total non-serious adverse events) Secondary objectives To assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in hypertensive patients on - change from baseline in systolic blood pressure - change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure - body weight reduction SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and from searches in reference lists and systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) in adult hypertensive patients were included if they had a study duration of at least 24 weeks and compared weight reducing dietary interventions to no dietary intervention in adult patients with primary hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Studies were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. In case of moderate or larger heterogeneity as measured by Higgins I2, a random effects model was used. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies involving a total of 2100 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 45 to 66 years met our inclusion criteria. Mean treatment duration was 6 to 36 months. No study included mortality as a pre-defined outcome. One RCT evaluated the effects of dietary weight loss on a combined endpoint, consisting of the necessity of reinstating antihypertensive therapy and severe cardiovascular complications. In this RCT weight reducing diet lowered the endpoint, hazard ratio 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.87) compared to no diet. None of the studies evaluated adverse events as designated in our protocol. Blood pressure was reduced in patients assigned to weight loss diets as compared to controls: systolic blood pressure (SBP)= weighted mean difference (WMD)= -4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -7.2 to -1.8 mm Hg (3 of 8 studies included in analysis), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)= WMD -3.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.8 to -1.5 mm Hg (3 of 8 studies included in analysis). Patients' body weight was also reduced in dietary weight loss groups as compared to controls, WMD of -4.0 kg (95% CI: -4.8 to -3.2) (5 of 8 studies included in analysis). Two studies used withdrawal of antihypertensive medication as their primary outcome. Even though this was not considered a relevant outcome for this review, the results of these studies strengthen the finding of reduction of blood pressure by dietary weight loss interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary hypertension, weight loss diets reduced body weight and blood pressure, however the magnitude of the effects are uncertain as a result of the small number of patients and studies that could be included in the analyses. It is not known whether weight loss reduces mortality and morbidity. No useful information on adverse effects was reported in the relevant trials.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"303","type":"report","title":"Do statins reduce blood pressure?: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials","journal":"Hypertension","authors":["Strazzullo, P.","Kerry, S.

A total of 291 and 272 patients were given a statin or placebo, respectively, in parallel group trials, whereas 265 took part in crossover trials receiving a statin and placebo (or probucol, in 1 trial). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients on statin than in those on placebo or control hypolipidemic drug (mean difference: -1.9 mm Hg; 95% CI: -3.8 to -0.1). The effect was greater when the analysis was restricted to studies with a baseline systolic blood pressure >130 mm Hg (Delta systolic blood pressure: -4.0; 95% CI: -5.8 to -2.2 mm Hg).

Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes. In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively. Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide. In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence). Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.","tags":["Epistemonikos"]},{"recNumber":"792","type":"report","title":"Quality improvement strategies for hypertension management: a systematic review","journal":"Medical care","authors":["Walsh, J.

STUDY SELECTION: Trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series evaluating QI interventions targeting hypertension control and reporting blood pressure outcomes were studied. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers abstracted data and classified QI strategies into categories: provider education, provider reminders, facilitated relay of clinical information, patient education, self-management, patient reminders, audit and feedback, team change, or financial incentives were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Forty-four articles reporting 57 comparisons underwent quantitative analysis. Patients in the intervention groups experienced median reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that were 4.5 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.5 to 11.0) and 2.1 mm Hg (IQR -0.2 to 5.0) greater than observed for control patients. Median increases in the percentage of individuals achieving target goals for SBP and DBP were 16.2% (IQR 10.3 to 32.2) and 6.0% (IQR 1.5 to 17.5). Interventions that included team change as a QI strategy were associated with the largest reductions in blood pressure outcomes. All team change studies included assignment of some responsibilities to a health professional other than the patient's physician. LIMITATIONS: Not all QI strategies have been assessed equally, which limits the power to compare differences in effects between strategies. CONCLUSION: QI strategies are associated with improved hypertension control. A focus on hypertension by someone in addition to the patient's physician was associated with substantial improvement. Future research should examine the contributions of individual QI strategies and their relative costs.","tags":["Epistemonikos","Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"880","type":"report","title":"Songling Xuemaikang Capsule (), for primary hypertension: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","journal":"Chinese journal of integrative medicine","authors":["Yang, X.

Certain agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents known as renin inhibitors.\rOBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to discuss the clinical pharmacology of aliskiren and its use in the management of hypertension, as well as potential uses in other cardiovascular disorders.\rMETHODS: Peer-reviewed articles and abstracts were identified from the MEDLINE and Current Contents databases (both 1966-October 1, 2007) using the search terms aliskiren, drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. Citations from available articles were reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at recent professional meetings were also examined.\rRESULTS: Nine published clinical studies have evaluated the effect of aliskiren in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. This review summarizes those studies. Patients treated with aliskiren had significantly lower blood pressure compared with patients with mild to moderate hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140-180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95-110 mm Hg) who received placebo. Aliskiren in doses of 75 to 300 mg daily produced reductions of SBP (-5.3 to -15.8 mm Hg) and DBP (-5.8 to -12.3 mm Hg); placebo produced reductions of SBP that ranged from -2.85 to -10.0 mm Hg and DBP reductions from -3.26 to -8.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05 in all studies between aliskiren and placebo). Aliskiren's blood pressure-lowering effect at doses of 75 to 300 mg daily was comparable to irbesartan 150 mg daily and valsartan 80 to 360 mg daily alone. When aliskiren was added to ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan, or valsartan, significant additive blood pressure-lowering effects were reported (P < 0.05 in all clinical trials). The total incidence of adverse events was similar to placebo and other comparative agents, including irbesartan, valsartan, losartan, ramipril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The overall adverse-event rates were 22%, 35% to 52%, 25% to 52%, 34% to 55%, and 33% to 52% for aliskiren 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events included headache, dizziness, and fatigue. Studies with cardiovascular outcomes as end points have not been performed with aliskiren.\rCONCLUSIONS: Aliskiren is an effective alternative agent for blood pressure management. Before aliskiren can be recommended as a routine first-line agent, however, clinical studies must explore if the blood pressure-lowering effect will translate into improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.

Spironolactone has shown improvement in 5 prospective studies and 1 retrospective study evaluating its blood pressuring-lowering abilities in patients with resistant hypertension. Specifically, the average blood pressure lowering noted in these trials with the addition of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension was 22/10 mm Hg.

The article also uses the theoretical framework of Dr Hans Selye's general adaptation syndrome. Yoga researchers demonstrate that yoga works because it modulates the physiological system of the body, specifically its effect on the heart rate. This review is significant because yoga presents an effective method of treating hypertension that is nonpharmacologic and therefore there are no adverse effects and there are other valuable health benefits. Research suggests that stress is a contributing factor to high BP; hence, the use of the general adaptation syndrome and the most important attribute of yoga, that is, it is a physical and mental exercise program, that is in sync with the philosophy of holistic nursing care where one treats the whole individual and not just the disease. The review was conducted with a search of computerized databases such as OVID, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic edition, PsychINFO, as well as reliable Web sites such as the cdc.gov, among others. An integrative review search was conducted, and 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. They include a combination of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and pilot studies. Yoga therapy is a multifunctional exercise modality with numerous benefits. Not only does yoga reduce high BP but it has also been demonstrated to effectively reduce blood glucose level, cholesterol level, and body weight, major problems affecting the American society. The completed integrative review provides guidelines for nursing implementation as a complementary treatment of high BP.Copyright 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","address":"Okonta,Nkechi Rose.

Long term effects (on mortality, morbidity or blood pressure) of advice to reduce salt in patients with elevated or normal blood pressure are unclear.\rOBJECTIVES: To assess in adults the long term effects (mortality, cardiovascular events, blood pressure, quality of life, weight, urinary sodium excretion, other nutrients and use of anti-hypertensive medications) of advice to restrict dietary sodium using all relevant randomised controlled trials.\rSEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies of included studies and related systematic reviews were searched for unconfounded randomised trials in healthy adults aiming to reduce sodium intake over at least 6 months. Attempts were made to trace unpublished or missed studies and authors of all included trials were contacted. There were no language restrictions.\rSELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion decisions were independently duplicated and based on the following criteria: 1) randomisation was adequate; 2) there was a usual or control diet group; 3) the intervention aimed to reduce sodium intake; 4) the intervention was not multifactorial; 5) the participants were not children, acutely ill, pregnant or institutionalised; 6) follow-up was at least 26 weeks; 7) data on any of the outcomes of interest were available.\rDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Decisions on validity and data extraction were made independently by two reviewers, disagreements were resolved by discussion or if necessary by a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analysis, sub-grouping, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were performed.\rMAIN RESULTS: Three trials in normotensives (n=2326), five in untreated hypertensives (n=387) and three in treated hypertensives (n=801) were included, with follow up from six months to seven years. The large, high quality (and therefore most informative) studies used intensive behavioural interventions. Deaths and cardiovascular events were inconsistently defined and reported; only 17 deaths equally distributed between intervention and control groups occurred. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced at 13 to 60 months in those given low sodium advice as compared with controls (systolic by 1.1 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.8 to 0.4, diastolic by 0.6 mm hg, 95% CI 1.5 to -0.3), as was urinary 24 hour sodium excretion (by 35.5 mmol/ 24 hours, 95% CI 47.2 to 23.9). Degree of reduction in sodium intake and change in blood pressure were not related. People on anti-hypertensive medications were able to stop their medication more often on a reduced sodium diet as compared with controls, while maintaining similar blood pressure control.\rREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Intensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. Further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. Evidence from a large and small trial showed that a low sodium diet helps in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. If this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.

The FDA Web site and manufacturer prescribing information were also reviewed to identify other relevant information.\rRESULTS: Compared with olmesartan 40 mg daily, azilsartan 80 mg reduced mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) by an additional 2.1 mm Hg (P = 0.038), whereas azilsartan 40 mg was noninferior to olmesartan 40 mg. Azilsartan 40 mg or 80 mg added to chlorthalidone 25 mg daily significantly reduced SBP to a greater extent than did chlorthalidone alone (P < 0.05), but there was no difference between azilsartan 40 mg and 80 mg (40 mg: -31.72 mm Hg; 80 mg: -31.3 mm Hg [P > 0.05]).

However, longitudinal intervention studies are more appropriate for assessing the effects of physical activity. We performed meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials involving dynamic aerobic endurance training or resistance training. The meta-analysis on endurance training involved 72 trials and 105 study groups. After weighting for the number of trained participants, training induced significant net reductions in resting and daytime ambulatory blood pressure of, respectively, 3.0/2.4 mmHg (P<0.001) and 3.3/3.5 mmHg (P<0.01). The reduction in resting blood pressure was more pronounced in the 30 hypertensive study groups (-6.9/-4.9) than in the others (-1.9/-1.6; P<0.001 for all). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 7.1% (P<0.05), plasma norepinephrine by 29% (P<0.001), and plasma renin activity by 20% (P<0.05). Body weight decreased by 1.2 kg (P<0.001), waist circumference by 2.8 cm (P<0.001), percentage body fat by 1.4% (P<0.001) and the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance by 0.31 units (P<0.01); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 0.032 mmol/l (P<0.05). Resistance training has been less well studied. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials (12 study groups) on mostly dynamic resistance training revealed a weighted net reduction in blood pressure of 3.2 (P=0.10)/3.5 (P<0.01) mmHg associated with exercise. Endurance training decreases blood pressure through a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, in which the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system appear to be involved, and favourably affects concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. The few available data suggest that resistance training can reduce blood pressure. Exercise is a cornerstone therapy for the prevention, treatment and control of hypertension.","address":"Fagard,Robert H.

Eight studies were identified. Eight separate analyses were used to compare combination therapy with respective monotherapies at the earliest available time points (weeks 1, 2 and/or 4).\rRESULTS: In patients initiated on combination therapy, greater systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) reductions were seen with combination therapy (p < 0.0001); BP (< 140/90 mmHg), SBP (< 140 mmHg) and DBP (< 90 mmHg) goal attainment rates were significantly higher with combination therapy at all time points.

We determined pooled estimates of the effect of treatment on group variability in BP (ratio of the variances [VR]) and on the risk of stroke vs myocardial infarction during follow-up.\rRESULTS: Compared with other antihypertensives, variability in SBP was increased more by nonselective beta-blockers (VR=1.34, 1.13-1.59, p =0.002, 25 comparisons, 9,992 patients) than by beta1-selective agents (VR=1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.19, p =0.053, 68 comparisons, 40,746 patients; difference-p =0.038).

In comparisons with other antihypertensives, the increase in stroke risk with nonselective beta-blockers ([OR]=2.29, 1.32-3.96, p =0.002) was more marked than with beta1-selective agents (OR=1.24, 1.08-1.42, p =0.003, difference-p =0.03), as was the risk of stroke relative to the risk of myocardial infarction: OR=1.50 (0.93-2.42) vs 0.99 (0.82-1.19).\rCONCLUSION: Use of beta1-selective rather than nonselective agents may be advisable when beta-blockers are indicated for patients at risk of stroke.","address":"Webb,Alastair John Stewart.

A lack of persistence with treatment has however been shown to be linked to a worse cardiovascular prognosis. This review explores the blood pressure reduction and persistence with treatment of antihypertensive drugs and the cost consequences of poor persistence with pharmaceutical interventions in arterial hypertension.\rMETHODS: We have searched the literature for data on blood pressure lowering effects of different antihypertensive drug classes and agents, on persistence with treatment, and on related costs. Persistence was measured as patients' medication possession rate. Results are presented in the form of a systematic review.\rRESULTS: Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs) have a competitive blood pressure lowering efficacy compared with ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers (BBs) and diuretics. 8 studies describing the persistence with treatment were identified. Patients were more persistent on ARBs than on ACEi and CCBs, BBs and diuretics. Thus the product of blood pressure lowering and persistence was higher on ARBs than on any other drug class. Although the price per tablet of more recently developed drugs (ACEi, ARBs) is higher than that of older ones (diuretics and BBs), the newer drugs result in a more favourable cost to effect ratio when direct drug costs and indirect costs are also considered.\rCONCLUSION: To evaluate drugs for the treatment of hypertension several key variables including the blood pressure lowering effect, side effects, compliance/persistence with treatment, as well as drug costs and direct and indirect costs of medical care have to be considered. ARBs, while nominally more expensive when drug costs are considered only, provide substantial cost savings and may prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality based on the more complete antihypertensive coverage. This makes ARBs an attractive choice for long term treatment of hypertension. [References: 50]","address":"Bramlage,Peter.

Case reports and clearly defined mechanisms of action provided strong evidence for the ability of ephedra and licorice to increase blood pressure. Coenzyme Q(10) was reported to decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure, although the mechanism is unclear. The clinical significance of the blood pressure effects of other NHPs is unclear due to lack of conclusive in vivo data, as well as substantial variability in the chemical content of preparations of NHPs.\rCONCLUSIONS: Among published information, there is little definitive evidence with regard to the impact of NHPs on blood pressure. Additionally, effects may vary in a given patient with the formulation and standardization of a particular product. Until research better characterizes the effect of NHPs on blood pressure, patients should be encouraged to talk with their healthcare provider before starting or stopping any herbal product.

With a thiazide used alone, the mean placebo-subtracted reduction in systolic blood pressure was 7.3 mm Hg and 14.6 mm Hg combined with a drug from another class.

Only patients treated with placebo and the three commonly used nebivolol dosages (5, 10, and 20 mg/day) are presented. Baseline-to-endpoint changes in trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR) were analyzed for each age quartile using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. Tolerability was assessed by means of adverse event (AE) rates.\rRESULTS: The analysis comprised 205 placebo-treated patients and 1380 patients treated with nebivolol dosages of 5, 10, or 20 mg/day. Older age was associated with higher SBP values at baseline. In all age groups, each of the three most frequently used nebivolol dosages significantly reduced DBP, compared with placebo (-9.1 to -11.8 mmHg versus -3.4 to -5.9 mmHg; p < 0.008 overall). For SBP, a statistically significant effect versus placebo was observed for all dosages and age groups except for 5 and 10 mg/day in Group 4. Within each group, treatment with nebivolol (all three dosages) and placebo resulted in similar AE rates (nebivolol: 26.1-36.6%; placebo: 36.2-42.6%) and AE-related discontinuation rates (1.8-3.8% versus 0-4.3%). In each age group, there were no significant nebivolol-placebo differences in the rates of patients who experienced clinically significant changes or abnormal endpoint levels of metabolic parameters.\rCONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis suggests that nebivolol monotherapy is efficacious and well tolerated across various age groups, with the efficacy in reducing SBP somewhat diminishing in patients over 62 years of age.","address":"Germino,F Wilford.

Package inserts from lercanidipine, nifedipine, felodipine, and amlodipine were also reviewed for comparison of adverse effects.\rSTUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were limited to clinical trials, abstracts, and review articles published in English.\rDATA SYNTHESIS: Lercanidipine is a novel dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium-channel blocker indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Although it is not yet available in the US, lercanidipine has been utilized extensively in other countries. In 2 randomized controlled trials of approximately 400 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, lercanidipine showed efficacy similar to that of 2 other DHPs, felodipine and slow-release nifedipine, in significantly reducing systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 4 weeks. In a longer trial (12 mo), lercanidipine 10 mg/day led to normalized blood pressure in 49% of patients after 4 weeks. A postmarketing trial of 9050 patients corroborated the results observed in previous clinical trials, with 64% of patients achieving a DBP of less than 90 mm Hg and 32% attaining blood pressure control (<140/90 mm Hg). In elderly patients, lercanidipine was found comparable with lacidipine and nifedipine, showing similar decreases in DBP when compared with nifedipine (-18.3 vs -17.7 mm Hg, respectively). What distinguishes lercanidipine from other members of the DHP class is its lower incidence of adverse effects, particularly edema. One study showed that fewer patients withdrew secondary to adverse drug reactions in the lercanidipine (0.9%) and nifedipine (3.8%) group compared with the felodipine (4.5%) group. Lercanidipine has also shown efficacy similar to that of other antihypertensives, including atenolol, captopril, and losartan.\rCONCLUSIONS: Lercanidipine may be an option in the treatment of hypertension, as current literature suggests comparable antihypertensive efficacy and better tolerability. Further randomized, double-blind clinical trials must be conducted in order to clarify its position among other antihypertensive medications. [References: 40]","address":"Beckey,Cherylyn.

Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure.\rOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of magnesium supplementation as treatment for primary hypertension in adults.\rSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.\rSELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral magnesium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up >/=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) >/=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >/=85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.\rDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.\rMAIN RESULTS: Twelve RCTs (n=545) with eight to 26 weeks follow-up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving magnesium supplements as compared to control did not significantly reduce SBP (mean difference: -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5, I(2)=67%), but did statistically significantly reduce DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9, I(2)=47%). Sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality trials yielded similar results. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of magnesium, baseline blood pressure or the proportion of males among the participants.\rAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In view of the poor quality of included trials and the heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.

This article reports pooled changes in sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR) at trough; proportions of responders (patients whose end-point sitting DBP at trough was <90 mm Hg or whose sitting DBP at trough had decreased from baseline by <10 mm Hg); and the most frequent adverse events (AEs).

The angiotensin II receptor blocker, telmisartan, provides 24-hour BP-lowering efficacy and is proven to prevent cardiovascular morbidity in high-risk patients.\rMETHODS: Pooled data from seven randomized controlled trials (3,654 patients with stage 1-2 hypertension) were analyzed to investigate the BP-lowering efficacy of telmisartan 40 or 80 mg (T40 or T80) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg (H12.5 or H25) when compared with either placebo or telmisartan monotherapy, relative to patients' baseline BP. BP-lowering efficacy was also assessed in subpopulations. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in seated trough clinic systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP).\rRESULTS: In the overall population and across all baseline BP categories, T40/H12.5, T80/H12.5, and T80/H25 resulted in additional BP reductions to those provided by telmisartan monotherapy. In patients with baseline SBP>170 mmHg, T80/H25 effected a mean SBP change of -39.2 mmHg compared with changes of -25.5 mmHg and -8.3 mmHg observed with T80 and placebo treatment, respectively. Mean DBP changes were -20.4 mmHg T80/H25, -12.2 T80 and -5.9 placebo in patients with baseline DBP>105 mmHg. T80/H25 also resulted in larger BP reductions than telmisartan monotherapy in black patients with hypertension, irrespective of baseline BP. In patients with hypertension with type 2 diabetes and in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, both T80/H12.5 and T80/H25 were more effective than monotherapy in reducing BP in all baseline BP categories.\rCONCLUSION: Combination treatment of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide results in large and clinically relevant BP reductions additional to those provided by monotherapy.","address":"Neldam,Steen. neldam@dadlnet.dk","tags":["Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"2004","type":"report","title":"A meta-analysis of randomized head-to-head trials of telmisartan versus other angiotensin II receptor blocker in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for reduction of blood pressure","journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","authors":["Takagi, Hisato","Mizuno, Yusuke","Goto, Shin-Nosuke","Umemoto, Takuya","All-Literature Investigation of Cardiovascular Evidence, Group"],"date":"Sep 10 2013","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=medl&AN=23200265","http://ZL9EQ5LQ7V.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=OVID:medline&id=pmid:23200265&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.ijcard.2012.11.081&issn=0167-5273&isbn=&volume=167&issue=6&spage=3062&pages=3062-5&date=2013&title=International+Journal+of+Cardiology&atitle=A+meta-analysis+of+randomized+head-to-head+trials+of+telmisartan+versus+other+angiotensin+II+receptor+blocker+in+combination+with+hydrochlorothiazide+for+reduction+of+blood+pressure.&aulast=Takagi&pid=%3Cauthor%3ETakagi+H%3BMizuno+Y%3BGoto+SN%3BUmemoto+T%3BAll-Literature+Investigation+of+Cardiovascular+Evidence+Group%3C%2Fauthor%3E%3CAN%3E23200265%3C%2FAN%3E%3CDT%3ELetter%3C%2FDT%3E"],"pages":"3062-5","volume":"167","number":"6","isbn":"1874-1754","tags":["Medline Ovid"]},{"recNumber":"81","type":"report","title":"Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics for primary hypertension","journal":"","authors":["Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: Plain Language Summaries -
